I then made a new branch, https://github.com/edx/django-wiki/tree/rc/2014-11-21, off of the old release branch (https://github.com/edx/django-wiki/tree/edx_release) and then rebased it atop edx/django-wiki master.\r\n\r\nDoing a compare, you can see that the rc/2014-11-21 branch contains the django-wiki master branch plus two commits: https://github.com/edx/django-wiki/compare/edx:master...rc/2014-11-21\r\n\r\nI think this is the safer way to go, until we can submit patches upstream.

There is now a working document for testing the tools in a live setting found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BcGZRlOHTyBiBsk6OreUXzkU3m8Ju2K6hGic6Lw-9k/edit#). \r\n\r\n**Studio Changes:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Changes:** Note the [feature request](https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/TNL-596). Here are screenshots of things you should now see:\r\n1. In the Image Annotation Tool, you should see a white and black border around selections now. This is to help in black/white images where the dark border might fade into the background.\r\n![Double borders](http://i.imgur.com/Oy5CA1K.jpg)\r\n2. In the Image Annotation Tool, if you put in a tag you should now see the border change to the appropriate color (it takes a second to wait for a response from the annotation server) and it changes the tag to the same color:\r\n![colored borders and tags](http://i.imgur.com/LLYPsNz.jpg)\r\n3. 2 minor CSS changes which will be noted in line comments within the code changes. One to add the missing icon for resizing the text box:\r\n![resize image](http://i.imgur.com/LPHZv4q.png)\r\nAnd the other one is to make the reply box the same size as the box when you create an annotation, i.e. shorter as it usually goes off the page:\r\n![resize reply editor](http://i.imgur.com/odkDO57.png)\r\n4. These will be noted in the code as well, 2 small oversights causing issues: First, even though TinyMCE is now loaded if you enter and exit full screen mode in the image annotation, apparently hitting ESC is a different call, so I\'ve extended TinyMCE to be reloaded if a user hits escape. Second, our backend developer noted that users would sometimes hit errors when trying to create annotations within text that included <font> tags. I\'ve created a basic stupid check to make sure I\'m sending the right information. He\'s creating a fix on his end to double the stupid check to make sure it doesn\'t happen even if it slips through a crack from my end.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n1. Install the [tarball](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz) as usual.\r\n2. In the image annotation tool create an annotation. It should contain a black/white double border.\r\n3. Add a predeterminted tag (it should autocomplete if you start typing either "teachingAssistant" or "professor") and it should change the color of the border as well as the tag in the viewer that pops up if you scroll over it.\r\n4. Refresh the page to make sure it still works and is being saved on the backend\r\n5. Hit the reply button. Note that the resize image and the width of the box are as shown in the images above.\r\n6. Open up the image in fullscreen mode (there\'s a button next to the "Annotate" button). Once there hit escape or select "Exit fullscreen". Try creating an annotation and see if you can type into the editor. Before once you were out of fullscreen mode and tried to create an annotation it would not allow anything to be typed into the editor. Now it should work as intended.'

This fixes TNL-399 (which, interestingly, was not an issue for split modulestore).\r\n\r\nNote that there is still a chance that the "Published" vs "Unpublished Changes" status will get out of date, if an xblock is doing AJAX callbacks.

In some parts of the codebase, such as `edx-platform/lms/djangoapps/bulk_email/tasks.py`, all calls to `dog_stats_api` are wrapped with `_statsd_tag()` which prevents these UnicodeErrors. But elsewhere in the codebase, `dog_stats_api` methods called with tags that are unicode strings, potentially causing UnicodeErrors and resulting in statistics being under-reported, should the tags contain any non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I refactored the code so that *all* calls to the DataDog API are wrapped. At the same time I added a couple other checks/cleanups to the wrapper method to ensure stats reporting is as robust as possible:\r\n* Trim the tags to 200 characters while they are unicode strings, *then* encode them as UTF-8. Doing it vice-versa as the previous `_statsd_tag()` method did can result in splitting multi-byte characters and thus corrupt strings.\r\n* Replace `|` character if present, as statsd uses it as a field separator\r\n\r\nI considered making this an upstream patch to the dogapi package but the simplest approach I found would break backwards compatibility, and not doing so would require a larger change (adding the `six` package etc.) as they support Python 2.7 and 3.x. Changing edx-platform is simpler.\r\n\r\n**Affects**: Unknkown. Not likely to affect too many courses/instances at this time.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**: Reverse the one-line fix to student/models.py made in #5386, then run the test that was part of that PR. Check over the detailed test failure log output. You will see the logged warnings quoted above.\r\n\r\n**Urgency**: Low. Just a warning in the logs and at worst result in missing stats data.\r\n\r\n**Authorship**: This is a contribution from OpenCraft.\r\n\r\n**Partner information**: 3rd party-hosted open edX instance, for an edX solutions client (so will need to get some sort of solution merged in)\r\n\r\n**Merge deadline**: Mon October 20 (soft requirement to minimize code drift, we may maintain it on the client fork in the meantime)\r\n'

That change could even be made now, but it changes how anonymous IDs are calculated, resulting in new hash values that won't match any previously generated hash values / anonymous IDs. Although previously generated anonymous IDs always get stored in a database and such a change is thus totally backwards compatible, there are a couple of unit tests and a runtime warning that are explicitly designed to catch such changes in how the digest is calculated. So for now I've stuck with the most clearly backwards-compatible route."

After a little more fiddling around it was discovered that the issue affected every item after the first "failure." This code changes the way that you verify that the thumbnail/annotation are from the image currently being shown on the same page. It checks that the thumbnail contains the substring of the id as per OpenSeaDragon\'s API. \r\n\r\n**Studio Changes:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Changes:** 1) Removed old way of checking (not sure why that method was chosen by my predecessor, but it seems like a super bad idea) if annotation referred to the image on the current page. 2) Added the fix @sarina asked me to make at the end of the las PR related to the release candidate this week. 3) Added a few more checks for annotation.highlights attribute that sometimes does not get made (i.e. replies). These are not code-breaking but the code is now more correct than it used to be and that\'s always a plus.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n1. Create a sandbox instance WITHOUT this fix/PR\r\n2. Install the [tarball](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz) as usual.\r\n3. Make a few random image annotations.\r\n4.

Originally I had fixed the bug where two competing TinyMCE initializations were interfering with each other by adding a condition to test if an editor already existed. The problem with that is that because of the dynamic loading aspect of units, the HTML containing the TinyMCE instance was deleted and could later not be found. A much better solution is below where if there exists a version of TinyMCE, i remove it and then call for it to be initialized after. \r\n\r\n**Studio Update:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Update:** Users should be able to switch from unit to unit and not lose RichText editing tools.\r\n\r\n**Testing:** \r\n1. Load the course using this [tarball](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz).\r\n2. Create an annotation in two text sources within the same subsection (but in different units)\r\n3.

5049,'','workaround for custom_tag being broken\nThe `<customtag>` construct is supported within edX XML (see http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/devdata/en/latest/course_data_formats/course_xml.html?highlight=custom_tag#customtag), and has been used on edx.org, but is currently broken for several MITx courses.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the custom_tag/*.xml files are being loaded by XML import as being "revision=\'draft\'", instead of "revision=null".  For example:\r\n\r\n    > db.modulestore.find({"_id.course":"2.01r","_id.category":"custom_tag_template"})\r\n    { "_id" : { "tag" : "i4x", "org" : "MITx", "course" : "2.01r", "category" : \r\n                   "custom_tag_template", "name" : "boardnotes", "revision" : "draft" }, \r\n     "definition" : { "data" ...\r\n\r\nThe proper fix is to figure out the xml importer, and make it import with the right revision.  In particular, "_id.revision" is the mongo key id corresponding to what is called the "branch" in the mongo modulestore code, and this ought to have been null instead of "draft".  But all that code is mucked up with split mongo and jazz.\r\n\r\nThis PR works around the problem by making the template_module (which handles `<customtag>`) search for the module within the "draft" branch, as a fallback, if it is not found in the default way.   This is pretty safe, as a patch, because it only affects that single module, and also, authoring of custom tags is not supported in Studio, and thus this only affects courses authoring XML directly, and these courses are not putting the customtag template definitions deliberately in the draft directory.\r\n\r\nThis fix has been tested with the residential MITx deployment, and is in production use at MIT.\r\n\r\nNote that edX-platform has no tests (as far as I see) for `<customtag>`, despite this feature being documented, and also being used in MITx courses on edX.  This PR, being a temporary workaround, also comes with no unit tests.  I admit the `except` clause could have been more explicit, and only catch the ItemNotFound error.   Perhaps some kind soul could fix this, if the patch gets used by edX.\r\n\r\nTo test it by hand, do something like this:\r\n\r\n1. create the file `custom_tags/under_construction` (no .xml suffix) with this content:\r\n\r\n    `<html display_name="Under Construction">`\r\n`         <div id="unique_seed" style="display:none">${unique_seed}</div>`\r\n`        <h2>This section is not quite ready yet&#8230;</h2>`\r\n       ` <center>`\r\n            `<img src="http://anticap.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/bridge-to-nowhere.jpg?w=614&h=446" width="80%"/>`\r\n       ` </center>`\r\n       ` <p style="text-align:right">&#8230;please check back later!</p>`\r\n    `</html>`\r\n\r\n2. add a sequential like this:\r\n\r\n        <sequential display_name="Board Notes W1" url_name="W1_F14_bn">\r\n            <customtag impl="under_construction" unique_seed="201408311540" display_name="Under Construction W1_F14_bn"/>\r\n        </sequential>\r\n\r\nWhen you visit the sequential you should see a page like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1590761/4128305/b224108e-3308-11e4-9aae-3d7dd0ca92d3.png)\r\n'

Basically, in the dict returned by the grading function (specified by python), I\'ve added an additional, *optional* key `grade_decimal`, that will specify the partial credit for that response (instead of binary 0 or max).  The `ok` key still controls "correctness" in `CorrectMap`, which shows up in the UI as controlling the "checkmark" versus "x" displayed to the student.  This partial credit functionality for the score of a response was surprisingly not present before.\r\n\r\nThe particular use case we have is that our compilers course has a programming component that\'s done via a downloaded VM.  Students can run a grading script on the VM, get a hash, and then copy and paste this hash into a custom-graded response with a textbox to get a score.  Since the score can any integer [0, 63], we needed to be able to specify partial credit.\r\n\r\n@jinpa as FYI.'

5020,'',"Hotfix - reduce number of Studio mongo calls\nThere was a large performance degradation seen today on Studio which a number of folks have been investigating. TL;DR I have a hotfix which Nimisha and I believe to have resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nThe issue was seen on unit pages (note: not the course outline page as was originally though) where the number of Mongo calls increased substantially. A typical example can be seen on New Relic, where a single unit page caused over 900 Mongo queries to be executed:\r\n\r\nhttps://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/88178/key_transactions/9482/x_rays/1073/profiles\r\n\r\nNimisha, Cale and Don investigated today and discovered that the problem was with the number of calls being made to has_changes. As part of bulk publishing, the logic was changed where has_changes was called for every xblock being rendered, rather than only for units. This was part of this PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/4750\r\n\r\nThis change was performance tested for the course outline page, but unfortunately it wasn't recognized that it would actually have a larger impact on the unit page so it wasn't tested there.\r\n\r\nDon implemented caching of has_changes so that the value for an xblock and all of its descendants are only computed once. This helped somewhat but not enough for a subtle reason. Nimisha and I investigated tonight and realized what the problem was. The logic for the unit page computes information for the unit page first, then recurses up to the parent to get its information, and continues all the way up to the course. This means that the caches are not available as the logic goes up the tree.\r\n\r\nI implemented a simple one line change on top of Don's fix that first calls has_changes on the course module itself, so that the entire tree of has_changes methods are called once and only once. This brought the number of Mongo calls back to reasonable levels based on tests that Cale wrote.\r\n\r\nHere are the results for Cale's tests with different branching levels. For example, a branching level of 3 tests with 3 sections, each of which has 3 subsections each of which has 3 verticals each of which has 3 problems. As you can see, the release branch numbers increase in some sort of exponential way as the course increases in size, but with the hotfix they are linear. This demonstrates that Don's caching is effective in avoiding unnecessary Mongo queries.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+=================+===========================================================+\r\n|                 |                        MONGO CALLS                        |\r\n+=================+===========================================================+\r\n| Branching level | Release branch | Release w/ Don's fix | Release w/ hotfix |\r\n+=================+================+=======================+==================+\r\n|    1            |        42      |         31            |       36         |\r\n|    2            |       122      |         78            |       39         |\r\n|    3            |       360      |        251            |       42         |\r\n+=================+================+=======================+===================+\r\n```"

This PR adds the appropriate items to requirejs to be loaded in the CMS.\r\n\r\n**Studio Update:** I added the appropriate CSS files to the pipeline. I added the files to requirejs in base.html. I made sure that tinymce is loaded via the STATIC_URL variable since it\'s different between CMS and LMS. Finally I added an if condition. If Annotator is not already loaded (i.e. undefined), it means that it is being called upon by Studio in which case it will run the require on the appropriate configuration script (i.e. ova.js or osda.js) and load all the dependencies. Unless I misunderstood how requirejs works, this should stop it from being loaded on every page, but rather only on the pages that load "ova" and "osda." \r\n\r\n**LMS Update:** None.\r\n\r\n**Testing:** Here\'s the [tarball](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz). Now in Studio if you go into any of the units you should be able to see the component instead of just "Loading..." and Annotator should exist which means you should be able to view the video, read the text, and view the image from Studio now.

4796,'','Annotation Tools: Fixing implicit typecasting and reordering plugins\n**Background:** During the last set of PRs there was a set of fixes asked by @sarina that required me to change from a system of implicit typecasting set by my predecessor to one of explicit typecasting. A bug was also introduced that removed the tagging feature from the annotation tool. This PR deals with both of those fixes.\r\n\r\n**Studio Update:** None\r\n\r\n**LMS Update:** In ```catch.js```, I\'ve now explicitly typecasted several items that were strings being treated as integers. This fixes the issues introduced in the last set of PRs which include: 1) the inability for people to edit via the table below, 2) the inability for people to hit the "quote" on text annotations in the table and get scrolled back to the line with the original piece of text, 3) the inability for people to hit the time signature on the video tool table and get scrolled back to the video to the correct time range, 4) the inability for people to hit the thumbnail image on the image annotation tool table and get panned and zoomed to the correct area of the image, 5) the inability for people to delete via the table below, and 6) the inability for people to reply to the annotation via the table below.  \r\n\r\nThe other issue dealt with was in ```ova.js```. It seems like Annotator has a specific way to traverse through plugins and plugins that deal with the body of an annotation *have* to happen before the ones dealing with the auxiliary values, such as tags. Otherwise risking something being overwritten. The changes in #4675 added a new "submit" function that deals with the body of the annotation. Originally, my predecessor had just added plugins in alphabetical order having not known about such an edge case. Moving the HighlightTags plugin to the end has now fixed the issue with our tagging system not working properly. \r\n\r\n**Testing:** \r\n1. Load up a course with the annotation tools installed (here\'s a dandy [tarball](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz)). \r\n2. Create a text annotation, an image annotation, and a video annotation.\r\n3. Under each of the above go to the table below and try to edit and reply.\r\n4. Hit the quoted text in the text annotation table and you should be scrolled to the line with the quoted text (the viewer doesn\'t pop up unfortunately...it never has, but it\'s something I want to add later).\r\n5. Hit the time signature in the video annotation table and it should scroll you to the video and it will automatically play and stop given the range of the annotation.\r\n6. Hit the thumbnail in the image annotation table and it should scroll you to the image viewer. It will pan and zoom to the thumbnail location (note that the image tool "saves" where the user was zoomed in and panned when it made the original annotation, i.e. if you make a tiny square when it\'s all zoomed out clicking on the thumbnail will zoom you out that far).\r\n7. Add a tag to the text annotation. If it\'s one of the predetermined tags (i.e. there should be a menu that appears as you type) then it should change color (even in Safari). Otherwise it should remain yellow.\r\n8. Try deleting each of the annotations made in step 2 using the table below each of the annotation sources.'

This also includes a quick change to the css for a missing class name in share-annotator.css\r\n\r\n**Studio Update:** TinyMCE should now be able to have a media button.\r\n\r\n**LMS Update:** Same as studio, the annotation tool TinyMCE instance should now have a media button. Also, the fix to the css file will fix a padding/margin issue in the editor view for the "Share this annotation" button. \r\n\r\n**Testing:** Using the following [tarball] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/r684ber7z4ddqtc/2014_T4.DPRfFs.tar.gz), you can create a test course. Go into any of the annotation tool units and highlight to create an annotation. Open up the editor. There should now be a media button. Press it and paste a link to a youtube video. Save the annotation and you should now be able to see the video in the pop-up and in the table below. The other fix prevents the Share this annotation and button from being misaligned in the editor.

Here\'s a quick breakdown of what I\'ve done:\r\n\r\n- Use Segment.io\'s alias and identify methods to correctly **join user histories in Mixpanel**\r\n- Report **new events** corresponding to **account registrations**, **sign-ins**, **course enrollments**, **course unenrollments**, enrollment **mode changes**, and enrollment **mode upgrades**, each with appropriate properties attached to indicate user actions (e.g., registering or signing-in to enroll in a course)\r\n  - These new events are designed to accompany the upcoming functionality change related to enrollment and track selection (i.e., enroll immediately on click of the "Register" button)\r\n- ~~Remove page view events like "Viewed Dashboard Page" and "Viewed Register Page" currently being sent to Mixpanel~~\r\n- Name events in accordance with the Analytics team\'s [event naming convention](http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/userdocs/en/latest/analytics.html#naming-events)\r\n- Where possible, roll Segment.io into our existing pipeline event emitter\r\n- Correctly use Google Analytics\' reserved event properties (**Categories**, **Actions**, and **Labels**) for better reporting from within the GA interface\r\n\r\n**N.B.** Some of the new events added by this PR require Segment.io\'s Python module. I\'ve renamed Miles Steele\'s `analytics` module to `instructor_analytics` to avoid a naming conflict with Segment.io\'s module, which has been added as a new dependency (@feanil, FYI). Segment.io\'s module uses a single extra thread to batch messages and flush them asynchronously to Segment.io\'s servers. Flushes occur the first time a message is received and every 50 messages thereafter, or if 10 seconds have passed since the last flush. The message batch size is configurable - I\'ve changed it from the default 20 to 50, but am interested in what others think the best size is.\r\n\r\n@dianakhuang and @mulby, could you help me review this? @shnayder and @griffresch, FYI.'

4517,'','Annotation Tools: Adding Loading Bar to Annotations Table\n**Background:** Quick and easy fix to slow loading of annotations: To make it easier for people with slower connections and people dealing with our annotations backend, we\'ve added a loading bar below the grid during loading of the annotations.\r\n\r\n**Studio Updates:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** If our backend is being slow or non-responsive, a loading bar should appear when switching between "MyNotes" and "Public" tabs. In theory most people should not see it (or should only be able to glance at it). A good way to test is to not put down a backend. It should just show a loading gif and a message telling people to please wait.\r\n\r\n**Test:** Set up text annotation via advanced_modules in "Advanced Settings". Load the component in a module and head over to the LMS. Once there switch between the Public and MyNotes tabs to see the message appear. If connected to a server it should disappear within milliseconds in an average connection. A slow connection might have it up for longer. If there are issues with the backend, it should just stick around and not disappear (a message should pop up on the top of the screen once the call times out saying they can\'t connect to the backend).

We had made this change on the bulk publishing branch (before the code was moved from mixed modulestore into the individual modulestores).\r\n\r\nNote that this is also consistent with the implementation in split.py. @nasthagiri and @cpennington please review.\r\n\r\nAs to the test_mixed_modulestore change, here is an e-mail from @nasthagiri describing the issue:\r\n_______\r\nThe problem is that the implementation of .replace is different between SlashSeparatedCourseKey and CourseLocator.  If you look at the _key member in the 2 locations, you\'ll see the underlying key object that is used.\r\n\r\nThe old implementation in SlashSeparatedCourseKey had overridden all attributes, including "branch" when .replace was called.  However, the new implementation in CourseLocator keeps the attribute values, including "branch".\r\n\r\nSo it seems one would NOT run into this issue if they happened to have used a SlashSeparatedCourseKey.\r\n\r\nThe location variable in create_item in base.py happens to be a SlashSeparatedCourseKey.  But when you changed it to return the return value of get_item, it happened to load the xblock, which creates a CourseLocator.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I believe the test in test_mixed_modulestore needs to be updated to be branch_agnostic.\r\n\r\n@cpennington , here\'s another case of a hard-to-debug issue having to do with comparison of Key objects - one having a Branch specified and the other not.  It just happened to work before since SlashSeparatedCourseKeys implemented .replace differently (only capturing the org/course/run from the previous object).'

Then make sure annotation_storage_url and annotation_secret_token are set. Head over to a unit and add the component. whenever you add annotations, if the button says that the grouping is on then the highlighting will not show up, but rather a sidebutton with the number "1" or whatever number of annotations you\'ve added.

If you are not an instructor, then nothing will have changed for you.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**  Initiate the annotation components using Advanced Settings to add advanced modules, annotation storage url, and secret token. Create a new unit and add a text annotation component. Set yourself as instructor. In the LMS create an annotation. Hover (you should see nothing new) and hit edit (you should see nothing new). Now hover again and hit the flag in the top right corner. The flag should now be black. If you move out and hover again it should now tell you that the annotation has been flagged once. Now if you hit edit, you will see the option to check a box if you would like to remove the flagged annotations. Otherwise leave it unchecked and save or hit cancel. '

They are completely independent of each other, which may create unintended consequences when used together.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Currently, if you select a tag that changes the color of the highlight and then "flag" the annotation, it will remove the coloring because they are tag-based. This PR adds one line of code (line no. 1035, an ```if``` statement) that checks to make sure that flagging tags are NOT taken into account when selecting the color of the annotation highlight.\r\n\r\n**Studio Updates:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Now, the color of the annotation highlight is the LAST non-flagging tag in the annotation tool. When someone flags an annotation it SHOULD NOT affect the color the annotation used to be.\r\n\r\n**Testing: ** Initiate the annotation components using Advanced Settings to add advanced modules, annotation storage url, and secret token. Create a new unit and add a text annotation component. In the LMS, highlight any part of the text and add a colored tag (it comes prepopulated with "imagery" as red and "parallelism" as blue). Save. Hover over the annotation and a viewer should come up. A flag on the upper left-hand corner should be there to "flag" the annotation as offensive. Now in the old version if you were to click on that flag and refresh the page, the annotation should be back to yellow instead of the color of the last tag, because you\'ve added a flagging tag. In this PR, it should remain the color you chose in the last nonflagging tag. '

Basically if you set the default tab to be instructor, the tool would give you the instructor tool as well as your personal ones. \r\n\r\n**Studio Updates**: None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates**:  When instructor is the default tab, you should only see instructor annotations instead of a mix of instructor and your own. \r\n\r\n**Testing**: Set up the text tool as usual (i.e. annotation storage url, secret token, advanced modules). Once it\'s set up add it to a module. In the settings for that component make sure you change the default tab to "Instructor" and that you add in an instructor email (helpful if it\'s valid, but also not necessary). Go into the LMS. Here create a few annotations (both as student and instructor, though if you didn\'t put a valid instructor email, you\'ll be looking for no annotations). Then reload the page. It should default to instructor with only the instructor annotations (if any) and none of your personal ones. Hitting the tab for "MyNotes" or "Public" should show you the appropriate annotations as well. Compare this to the current tool already in production which results in your personal annotations showing up alongside the instructor annotations. \r\n\r\n**Urgency**: It\'d be helpful to have this in either the release candidate for the week of the 14th or the one in the 21st.

Because of the overlays, whenever too many people annotated the image would be hidden behind the yellow colors. Background colors were ditched in favor of the border being the designated item. A bug also has been fixed which didn't allow you to Edit an annotation until another one had been created. \r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Minimal. Check to make sure that background is removed when image annotations are made. There should be a slight yellow tint during hover and when clicking the thumbnail in the table below. You should now also be able to edit an annotation when page loads instead of having to create an annotation, delete it and edit the original one. \r\n\r\n**Testing: ** Basically follow instructions above.

A hover pop-up should display the annotation text along with a Sharing button. When that button is clicked the lightbox appears with links to facebook, twitter, etc. The only thing that has changed is that the url below should now contain an extra URL parameter to designate the Unit where the Tool is present. Activating that link in a new window should have one of the following results:\r\n1. Text highlight will turn green and the page will scroll down to that line.\r\n2.

3969,'','Annotation Tool: Urgent update for ChinaX AB Testing\n**Background:** ChinaX is launching June 12 and they would like to do some AB Testing. @singingwolfboy said it would be possible to merge in for next weeks release. Below you should not see any new files (i.e. they all already exist in master) and only changes to the functionality. There are some files (catch.js in particular) that are extremely messy and will be worked on in future PRs so I plead focus on the changes and not the overall messiness of the file. We have in our dock changes such as the template structure and separating it out into a more MVC model but are limited with timing and resources.\r\n\r\n**AB Testing:** What will be tested is the following:\r\n1. Group A will get an image annotation tool that does not have the annotation tool instantiated. It is merely an OpenSeaDragon viewer that you can zoom in deep.\r\n2. Group B will get an image annotation tool that is readonly (except by the instructor) and will be able to see the instructor\'s annotations but not create any of their own.\r\n3. Group C will get an image annotation tool that works as originally intended. Both instructor and students will be able to see and create annotations.\r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** The only changes in the backend are the introduction of 3 new variables in settings. One to set the default tab for the annotation table. One to select the "mode" in which it will be used, either read-only or read/write. One to add the email of the user that will be considered the "instructor" of the course. \r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Most of these scenarios to keep in mind are only appropriate to the image tool: \r\n1. the table should default to whatever tab is typed in to default_tab \r\n2. If you are in annotation_mode 2 (everyone can edit)\r\n  * if you don\'t put in instructor then the instructor tab does not appear\r\n  * if you put in an instructor then the instructor tab appears\r\n3. If you are in annotation_mode 1 (only instructor can edit)\r\n  * if you don\'t put in instructor then the student should not see the table at all \r\n  * if you do put in instructor then you should see the table and view the instructor\'s annotations but the "create annotation" button on the image should be gone.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is a hackish way of doing this functionality. Because I\'m the only developer on this and our backend person is not currently available I couldn\'t use an API call to the backend server automate most of of the instructor calls. The name "instructor_username" is used because eventually we want to pass in the username instead of the email, but for now that was the only thing the code let me do in such short notice. Thank you so much for giving it your time. This PR is high priority should go in before the one that used to be #3529. I\'m still working on that one but had to deviate to get this one through. '

The default setting is \'draft\' (used by CMS and Preview) which prefers Draft versions over Published versions.\r\n* Since (most) test code now go through the Draft store, some tests needed to be updated to explicitly Publish their newly created items if they assumed they would be in that state.\r\n* API changes:\r\n  * Updated APIs for `has_item`, `get_parent_locations`, `get_items`, and `delete_item` to take in a `revision` parameter.  Refer to docstrings for more detail.\r\n* Improvements to the implementation of the following APIs:\r\n  * Publish - so it automatically publishes all the downstream children.\r\n  * Delete - so it does the "right" thing depending on which revision is deleted, etc.\r\n\r\n**Settings**\r\n* Changed the configuration setting format so the Stores listed in the Mixed configuration can be ordered by preference, via a `list` rather than a `dict`.\r\n* Updated the settings for all Test code so they should all go through Mixed, unless they are explicitly testing a particular store.\r\n* Introduced a new Setting called `MODULESTORE_BRANCH` that specifies the default "branch" (draft or published) to be used by relevant modulestore methods.

Under advanced_modules input "imageannotation". Under annotation_storage_url input the given *test* url link (note that this is different between http/https) -- feel free to email for information regarding this and the annotation_secret_token. Now head over to create a unit and there should now be an option for "Advanced" that includes "Image Annotation." Once selected you can go to Edit->Settings to change the blob that holds the image. A sample one is provided but as long as you have access to a IIIF server, any blob can go in. \r\n\r\n**Background:** This was a compromise made between me, @singingwolfboy, and @nedbat in order to meet a hard deadline for the image annotation tool for an upcoming course. This PR replaces #3744 except it is now not dependent on #3480 and #3529. It contains some of the same flaws that the image annotation tool and video annotation tool contain, but as can be seen by the consistent updating and pull-requesting, I am committed to make those changes outside of this time constraint. Nitpicks should be noted, but if they have no adverse effect on the overall functionality, I\'d plead to have them wait and added onto #3480 or #3529. \r\n\r\n**Studio Updates:** The new annotation tool looks very similar to the other two tools. There are no annotations done in the studio side of things. The settings should allow for a new image blob and a a place for prepopulated tags. \r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** The new annotation tool contains the same grid effect as the other two tools. It uses OpenSeadragon to contain a deep image zoom using a IIIF server maintained by HarvardX and referenced in the blob. It contains a fullscreen mode that still allows for creation of annotations. The grid now contains a thumbnail of the image highlighted/annotated (thanks to our IIIF server) and clicking on it should zoom/pan the image to show it off. \r\n\r\n**Testing:** Testing should happen the same way as the rest of the tools. zoom/pan through the image, make sure you can create/edit/delete an annotation. They should populate through the table at the bottom of the screen. In that table you should be able to edit/delete as well as reply to the annotation. Clicking on the thumbnail should take you directly to the highlighted image within the openseadragon view at the top. '

It includes some minor fixes that are require to get a working Discussion xblock in an external application. The changes:\r\n\r\n* Added the support of a baseUrl in Discussion.Util. When using discussion through jquery-xblock, we need a way to specify the LMS base url.\r\n\r\n* The $.ajax beforeSend hook was in conflict with jquery-xblock, which also use that hook for http header etc. Since the beforeSend hook in Discussion.Util wasn't related to the http request itself, the logic can be done otherwise with the same behavior. \r\n\r\n* There were a missing import in a template.\r\n\r\n* I've splitted the discussion application style in its own file. That way, it is generated on the LMS and can be grabbed from my discussion xblock to get the exact same styles. Something I have noticed is that the discussion-app.css is relatively big, since it probably contains bourbon etc. This is required to use the discussion module in an external application, but might be considered as *overhead* inside the LMS itself. I would like to get your advice about this. Ideally, the LMS and XBlock should use the exact same style source to ensure we have the same result on both... but we could also let the discussion styles bundled to application-extend2, for those that uses the xmodule. \r\n\r\n@jimabramson @antoviaque Although those changes are minor, I'll let you decide whether we include it now or not.

This means that,\nwhen /favicon.ico is requested on themed edX, one gets a 404 error.\n\nThis is a pity because there is already a FAVICON_PATH setting which\ncontains the path to the favicon and which already points to the\ntheme\'s one when a theme is enabled.\n\nSo this PR improves the way /favicon.ico is served in several ways:\n\n1. The instruction adding the pattern to the list is moved outside of the\nif not settings.FEATURES["USE_CUSTOM_THEME"] block, so that the pattern\ngets added independently of whether a custom theme is enabled or not.\n\n2. The redirection makes use of settings.STATIC_URL, instead of the\nhard-coded \'/static\' used in the original code.\n\n3. The microsites configuration is taken into account, so that if a\nmicrosite provides its own favicon.ico, it will be that file which will be\nreturned. This is inspired by lms/templates/main.html.\n\n4. The redirection uses the FAVICON_PATH setting. This setting is\ntheme-sensitive, so when a custom theme is enabled, FAVICON_PATH is\nmodified to point to the theme\'s favicon rather than to edX\'s one.\nSo the redirection now benefits from this already implemented behaviour.'

It follows the previous 3 chunks (#3466, #3480, and #3529). \r\n\r\n**Goal of this PR:** This PR introduces the image annotation tool. It follows the exact same format as the text and video annotation tools and reuses some of the same files. The key goal here is to provide the user the ability to select rectangular chunks of an image and add a comment via a tinymce input widget. The rest of the tool works the same way as the text and video ones (e.g. the annotation gets put into a table below which allows for replies and editing, etc.)\r\n\r\n**Studio Updates:** The functionality should follow the one from the text and video annotations. You should be able to go to the module settings and change the image via a json chunk that will be provided to the instructor.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** This PR will allow students to annotate images. Follow the guidelines below for thorough checking. \r\n\r\n**Testing notes:** Studio team should follow the "Instructions" above to instantiate the tool. Then both Studio and LMS should do the following:\r\n     1. Does the Image show up? Image should display. You should be able to zoom and pan depending on the resolution and even fullscreen it. There should be a small navigator window that can be used to pan and buttons for zooming in and out.\r\n     2. Can you annotate? Hit the "Create annotation" button and there should be a green border signifying that it is editable. The cursor should change to crosshairs. Now click and drag a portion of the image to create an annotation. The annotation widget should pop up with a tinymce editor. Use this to create an annotation and hit "Save." Now whenever you hover over the higlighted block you should see a pop-up that shows the annotation. You can edit or delete on that pop-up viewer. \r\n    3. Did it store? You should be able to see the annotation in the table below (even after refreshing). You should be able to click open the row to show more information. Here you should be able to edit or even delete the annotation from here. The other functionality is also being able to reply to it. Once you hit the reply link a pop up should show up that will contain another tinymce editor to which you can type in a reply. After it is created a new link should show up that says "Show/Hide Replies." '

Create a new private unit (in Studio).\r\n2. Link to it from a public unit with `/jump_to_id/<unit ID>`.\r\n3.

Moving these files caused a few UI issues which have also been patched within the code.\r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** You should now be able to create annotations within the CMS (this is not really used as of yet and the annotations cannot be viewed by students, only by instructors visiting Studio) which will not appear in LMS, but only when you visit the Studio end for the unit/module. The functionality should be there fully, leaving annotations, diacritic marks, highlighting, tagging. The CMS has its own table below the text that can be used as seen in the LMS.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** The biggest change visually is that the skin used for the TinyMCE editor is now the one used by Studio and not the one that was previously loaded onto the code. The rest should be the same as it was in a previous iteration. \r\n\r\n**Testing notes:** Probably hardest PR to test. Visually everything should look the same as before (except the TinyMCE Editor) and it should have the same functionality. I\'d suggest making a few annotations, editing them, deleting them, tagging them, adding diacritic marks, replying to one. Overall most of the "testing" should just be that the code is in the correct place.'

3481,'','Implement better editor tracking of dirty state\nThis is a fix for TinyMCE to resolve STUD-1576. The challenge is that sometimes TinyMCE triggers content changes when focus is lost, which causes Studio\'s editor to re-save the content. This is an issue when the user is only trying to change the mode from visual to raw, because then their content also gets corrupted.\r\n\r\nI\'m now watching for keyboard, paste and drop events to determine whether the user has intentionally made a change. The code determines that the editor is dirty if at least one of such events has happened *and* the text compares as being different from its original state. I need the latter clause in case the user makes an edit but then deletes it, or if the only keys they use are non destructive like the arrow keys. \r\n\r\nTo test this, use the following piece of HTML which appears to be the smallest example that triggers the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<head>\r\n<title>Example: Adding Four Forces</title>\r\n<style type="text/css">\r\n.collapseButton {\r\nfloat:right;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n</head>\r\n<h3>Heading</h3>\r\n```'

This is PR Chunk #2. #3466 is the first chunk.\r\n\r\n**Goal of this PR:** First goal is to clean up a few CSS changes: 1) The "display name" gets a little wonky with the text annotation module, there\'s a fix for it here only when it\'s within the annotator-wrapper. 2) Fixing the size of the panel for the widget. 3) Fixed the size of the dropdown for the tags. The second goal is to add the Diacritic Plugin that I\'ve written for the annotator tool. The last is to fix the plugin for colored tags. It will allow for user-generated tags instead of only instructor-designated ones.\r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** UI Fix, the title should not be off the module anymore. \r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** User should now be able to create tags even if they are not in the dropdown menu. If the instructor wants them to use diacritic marks they will see a list of appropriate marks underneath the tags that you can check on or off. A mark should appear or disappear accordingly. \r\n\r\n**Testing notes:** In studio, under the settings tab of the text annotation module there will now be an option to include diacritic marks. Use the following in order to get the "breve" symbol to show up: ```breve;http://i.imgur.com/PbSLGLP.gif;top``` Then head over to the LMS and once you highlight you should see the "breve" option appear as one you can check. Hitting save will make that appear. "breve" will also be a "tag" but it will not disappear if you delete that tag in the editor until you check off the box.\r\n\r\nTo test the tags just add whatever tag you want. If it\'s one from the dropdown menu it\'ll change to the appropriate color, otherwise it will tell you to hit ENTER to add a personal tag and it will be the default yellow highlight.'

The first is to use the Firebase Token Generator from the [PyPI version of Firebase](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/firebase-token-generator/1.3.2) and the second is to pass the token as a string rather than create a view (in djangoapp/students) that pops up with the token as a string in the body of the html.\r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** This one still follows the original first push in that Annotator is not yet working in the CMS (this will change in one of the following chunks). In terms of creating a test environment, the Firebase Token Generator uses a different token standard and the current testing backend does not meet those so please email me to ask for a new secret token and url link to the annotation_storage_url. There are no UI changes.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Nothing should change in the UI of the LMS, only the way that the token is handled should change. The secret token and url links have been changed so email me for updates. \r\n\r\n**Testing notes:** Once the proper secret token and URL  are placed you should be able to create annotations in the LMS (*not* the CMS). There is a problem if you get a black bar at the top saying "annotation could not be stored" or if you get a 401 error in the console debugger.'

This PR also adds two new user superproperties: one tracking whether a user is registered (always true for authenticated users - @marcotuts noted that this condition is appropriate for the analysis he wants to perform in Mixpanel), and the other tracking a user\'s current enrollment count. In order to achieve this, I had to update the Segment.io tracking snippet we\'ve been using.\r\n\r\nMy approach here sends named "Page" events to Segment.io, which then routes these to Mixpanel as "Viewed [Name] Page" events. For example, if Segment.io receives a page event named "Registration," Mixpanel will be sent an event named "Viewed Registration Page." Once this is merged in, I\'ll turn off the auto-generated "Loaded a Page" events which are currently being sent to Mixpanel by Segment.io; the "Viewed Other Page" event, which contains the URL of the viewed page as a property, will take its place.\r\n\r\n@sarina and @dianakhuang, could you please help me review this?\r\n\r\n@shnayder, FYI.'

3272,'singingwolfboy','Introducing JSHint.\n**Description**\r\n\r\nI want to propose the following guidelines to all future JavaScript code changes.\r\n\r\n1.) All authors that write and submit JavaScript code (as a pull request, or a separate commit) should run JSHint against the code. The configuration file `.jshintrc` (to be used by all developers) will be placed in the `edx-platfoirm` root. When `jshint` runs, it first checks for `.jshintrc` file in the same directory as the source file, and then travels up the source tree, until it either finds a `.jshintrc` file or (if no `.jshintrc` file is found) uses built-in defaults. Our aim that all developers run JSHint with a standard configuration file, and that there are no hard-errors (see NOTE at the end) reported by JSHint.\r\n\r\n2.) When in doubt about JSHint errors/warnings - use the latest JSHint from [http://www.jshint.com/install/](http://www.jshint.com/install/).\r\n\r\n3.) All new JavaScript files should use the following template:\r\n\r\n    (function (globalVar1, globalVar2, ...) {\r\n        \'use strict\';\r\n        // Your code goes here. In this code you can use globalVar1 etc.\r\n        // and not get an "used before defined" JSHint error. Also, being\r\n        // explicit about what is global is a good way to go!\r\n    }).call(this, window.fullNameGlobalVar1, window.fullNameGlobalVar2, ...);\r\n\r\n4.) All existing JavaScript files that are modified should be updated so that they pass against JSHint using the edx-platform `.jshintrc` file, and rewritten to use the wrapper anonymous function template from above.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I believe that only JSHint warnings should be disregarded of the type "unused variable", when that unused variable is a function parameter that can\'t be removed. For example:\r\n\r\n    (function ($) {\r\n        \'use strict\';\r\n\r\n        var test = [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\'];\r\n\r\n        $.each(test, function (index, value) {\r\n            console.log(value);\r\n        });\r\n    }).call(this, window.jQuery);\r\n\r\nIn this case JSHint will give a warning about `index` not being used. It is safe to disregard these kind of warning.\r\n\r\n**Special thanks** to @jmclaus for providing his original `.jshintrc` file! It was modified a bit.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nOften, JSHint will catch silly errors right in the editor. You will see that you have coded something wrong without having to start up Studio or LMS and checking your changes in the browser. We all know the pain of waiting for the system to start up only to find that you have let a little JavaScript syntax error slip by.\r\n\r\nAlso, for a long time we are without a JavaScript standard and guidelines. I think with the introduction of JSHint, JavaScript code in edX will start to be formalized and standardized.\r\n\r\n**Reviewers**\r\n\r\nI want to hear the thoughts about this PR from all JavaScript developers at edX who are interested in improving the quality of JavaScript code at edX.

It reorders commits and combines all the commits related to switching to TinyMCE 4.0.20.\r\n\r\nThis PR continues #2657. We had 2 issues that we needed to resolve in order for TinyMCE to work on the LMS instructor page (bulk e-mail) in our production environment (which uses the Cloudfront CDN). Note that we do not host the static files on Cloudfront for Studio, which is why this bug was only an issue for LMS.\r\n\r\n1. TinyMCE was dynamically loading its skin and plugin files. This bypassed our hashed files that are produced by our static file pipeline. In addition to the fact that incorrect files could be returned if any of these files are subsequently edited (until the CDN cache expires), this issue meant we weren't using the hashed font file. On Firefox, font files from a different origin can't be used unless something is put into their headers to allow the access-- and that change had only been made to the hashed files, as produced in our pipeline. Hence, toolbar icons (which come from the font file) were not displaying on Firefox. Note that the annotations usage of TinyMCE exhibits this bug currently in production.\r\n\r\n2. The codemirror plugin for TinyMCE was attempting to access JavaScript variables from different origins. When running on the CDN, the codemirror plugin is running on Cloudfront, but the frame holding TinyMCE is on our courses.edx.org server. Communication between the codemirror iframe and the frame hosting TinyMCE most happen through postMessage, instead of direct access to JavaScript variables.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects these 2 issues and also upgrades us to the most recent version of TinyMCE (4.0.20)."

This will happen, for example, in the case of the default 'Lyla' video in Studio, for Chrome or Safari  on Mac OSX but not for Firefox.

Hence, toolbar icons (which come from the font file) were not displaying on Firefox. Note that the annotations usage of TinyMCE exhibits this bug currently in production.\r\n\r\n2. The codemirror plugin for TinyMCE was attempting to access JavaScript variables from different origins. When running on the CDN, the codemirror plugin is running on Cloudfront, but the frame holding TinyMCE is on our courses.edx.org server. Communication between the codemirror iframe and the frame hosting TinyMCE most happen through postMessage, instead of direct access to JavaScript variables.\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects these 2 issues and also upgrades us to the most recent version of TinyMCE (4.0.20)."

I did not follow this path because it would have meant more code changes (no `Env.REPO_ROOT` anywhere), and would add instantiation of the class.   I prefer consensus on the approach first (so took the path closer to the current code).\r\n\r\n  - `assets.py`:\r\n     - for no particularly good reason, `THEME_COFFEE_PATHS` and `THEME_SASS_PATHS` set at module level (not w/in function);  not sure I like this.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nMy goal and intent is to have `Vagrantfile` and `update` both honor `build-version.yml` files as extra-vars. At that point, a developer\'s *Getting Started* guide to Open edX will be an easier thing to write.  This will simplify getting started, and maintaining edx instances, since common configurations will not require "deep" repository involvement.  `Build-version.yml` is consistent with and distinct from `server-vars.yml` (server configuration and settings).\r\n\r\nThis goal will involve a PR in the configuration repository (w.i.p.) to update the various `Vagrantfile` instances, and the `update` script template.\r\n\r\nWould you please review, @jzoldak & @singingwolfboy\r\n'

This is because the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference) is loaded by a simple `<script />` tag which causes the browser to halt all execution and wait for the script to load before continuing with fetching other JavaScript files, and rendering the DOM to the page.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nThe first time a page loads that has a YouTube API included, it tries to load the API. After some time, if nothing loads, or an error is returned, then the back-end will be notified that the user doesn't have YouTube available for them. A setting on the server will be stored. On next page load, the loading of the YouTube API will be skipped.\r\n\r\nAfter the page loads, an asynchronous request for the YouTube API will be made. If it is determined that YouTube API is once more available for the student, then the back-end will be notified that the student has access to the YouTube API. The appropriate setting will be updated, and the student will have YouTube API load on subsequent page loads.\r\n\r\n**Technical details**\r\n\r\nThe YouTube API is loaded from 3 points:\r\n\r\n1. The [Studio template](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/cms/templates/base.html) loads the API as a dependency via the Require JS interface.\r\n2. The [LMS template](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/lms/templates/courseware/courseware.html) loads the API as a simple `<script />` tag.\r\n3. The [OVA](http://openvideoannotation.org/) vendor JavaScript module [loads the API](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/common/static/js/vendor/ova/vjs.youtube.js) by programmatically inserting a script tag.

This cookie can be set on the [YouTube HTML5 page](http://www.youtube.com/html5) by requesting the HTML5 player.\r\n\r\nAfter requesting the HTML5 mode, going back to the edX video, and refreshing the page, we see that the HTML5 player loads, but that there is still 1 speed in the speeds dialog. Why is this happening?\r\n\r\nCode flow:\r\n\r\n1. Request HTML5 player for YouTube ID.\r\n2. For some reason Flash player loads (even though we specify `html5 = 1` in the `playerVars` settings array).\r\n3. The YouTube API reports that we have only 1 speed available.\r\n4. The codes thinks that we should switch to Flash player because there is only one speed available. This check was put in place back when the Firefox native HTML5 player did not support multiple speeds. Back then it was decided that if the native API reported only one speed, then we should switch back to Flash mode.\r\n5. After switching to Flash mode, the internal variable `currentPlayerMode` is set to `flash`.\r\n6. THE INTERESTING PART! The second time the API loads up, it is magically in HTML5 player mode! However, since the variable `currentPlayerMode` is set to `flash`, the code doesn't know to update the speed menu, even though the API reports us that we have multiple speeds available.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIn code, when we query available speeds from the API, if we get back multiple speeds, we disregard the `currentPlayerMode` if it is set to `flash`. We can only be in `html5` mode - Flash doesn't support multiple speeds. In this case, we set `currentPlayerMode` back to `html5`.\r\n\r\n**Reviewers**\r\n\r\n- @polesye "

My initial implementation of the feature is in https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/2717. However, by the time I coded the feature.... the Embargo feature has been merged in master. Since both features was similar, @jzoldak suggested that we should merge work and we agreed that it was making sense.\r\n\r\n## Additions \r\nThe main goal of my addition is to be able to restrict the main site access by Ip addresses and/or networks. Since the goal of the initial Embargo feature was to restrict by courses... I needed to modify some parts to fit my need. Here are my my 3 additions to EmbargoMiddleware:\r\n\r\n* Support of IP network in whitelist and blacklist. (We can now whitelist/blacklist with a network ip: like 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.0.2/32, 10.1.0.0/16).\r\n* New feature: SITE_EMBARGOED. This enable the the main site restriction using the same rules in the database (configured with django admin).\r\n* For SITE_EMBARGOED, we can define a redirect url in settings: EMBARGO_SITE_REDIRECT_URL to specify an external url to be redirected rather than a 403 response.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* My additions are entirely backward compatible if you were already using the Embargo feature. \r\n* The logic order to accept/deny a request has not changed (Blacklist --> State (geoip) --> Whitelist). *   * There is no change in the DB schema.\r\n* New tests have been added and all passed.\r\n\r\n## Requirements Change\r\n\r\n@jtauber : I've added a package in the requirements: ipaddr (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/), which is to manage ip addresses and networks. It is licensed under Apache 2. Let me know if there is any issue.\r\n\r\n@e0d : A new package has been added in requirements for the middleware: ipaddr (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/).

On the other hand, we want to present the user with a consistent user interface for saving (closing the modal dialog on cancel, showing/hiding the "Saving..." notification, etc.)\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with @cpennington and @andy-armstrong, I\'ve adopted the following approach:\r\n\r\n1) For native XBlocks, the Save/Cancel buttons are not rendered.\r\n2) On the client side, the Studio runtime now has a `notify()` method.  This allows the XBlock to notify Studio when certain events occur that might require a UI change (in this case, start/end of a save and cancel).\r\n3) The Studio JS runtime implements `notify()`, updating the UI in response to start/end of a save (show/hide the Saving... notification) and canceling an edit (close the modal dialog).\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of this approach: duplication of some UI logic (although surprisingly not too much) and the Tim XBlock will need to duplicate Studio styles for its buttons.  Given the tradeoffs and tight deadline, I think this is reasonable.\r\n\r\nSuggested reviewers:\r\n@cpennington @andy-armstrong \r\n\r\nhttps://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/browse/TIM-201'

Includes deletion of old version of CodeMirror and submission of new version (4.0.16).\r\n2) Includes CodeMirror plugin for TinyMCE (first submission), which has an Apache license.\r\n3) Changes to the HTML edit.coffee file to stop managing switching between CodeMirror and TinyMCE editors (for editing raw HTML and WYSIWYG editing, respectively). Instead, use the CodeMirror plugin.\r\n4) Rewriting of tests, and addition of integration tests for areas that previously weren’t tested.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had to edit the code of the CodeMirror plugin and the code for the link and image plugins for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nCodeMirror plugin for TinyMCE\r\n1) Needed to change paths of where CodeMirror files are expected to live to match how we store our vendor files. I am currently referencing the un-minified version of CodeMirror, but may change to minified after #2959 is merged.\r\n2) Fire events when CodeMirror plugin is shown and saved so that we can swap out static links (in CodeMirror editor only, else user sees broken links appear in TinyMCE Editor behind the dialog).\r\n3) Make sure to strip out the “caret” span that is being used to maintain caret position between TinyMCE and CodeMirror. There is a bug in the plugin that it doesn’t get removed if caret is in style block.\r\n\r\nImage and Link plugins\r\n1)  Fire an event when the plugin is closed (via OK) so we can rewrite links in TinyMCE view.\r\n\r\nCurrently no events are fired when a Plugin is triggered or when it goes away. I have submitted a feature request to TinyMCE for this.  http://www.tinymce.com/develop/bugtracker_view.php?id=6799\r\n\r\nI also posted a comment on the web page for the CodeMirror plugin about the bug related to the caret positional span.\r\n\r\nPlaces to test:\r\n1) HTML module components on unit page\r\n2) Static Pages\r\n3) LMS bulk emailer on the Instructor dashboard\r\n4) Check that annotations usage of TinyMCE is not broken in LMS\r\n\r\nNew test coverage added (integration):\r\n1) Test for style block being maintained (STUD-1434)\r\n2) Test that all expected toolbar buttons/dropdowns are present.\r\n3) Test for code format toolbar button\r\n4) Test for rewriting of links after using link plugin (test already existed for image plugin).\r\n\r\nI have deployed this branch to http://studio.cahrens.m.sandbox.edx.org/\r\n\r\nCode reviewers-- you may now start your engines.\r\n1) @marcotuts Can you visually review the CSS (talk to @frrrances about how it was generated)\r\n2) @andy-armstrong and @nasthagiri will do an in-person review with me\r\n3) @dcadams Can you take a look?\r\n4) @mhoeber Will need documentation updates.

2613,'',"fix raw grade dump in standard instructor dashboard\nThe standard instructor dashboard has had a longstanding bug in the procedure for generating raw grades.  The problem is that the index for the grades was generated by the records for the first student in the db.   As a result, if the first student had not tried all of the problems in the course, then two things would be wrong: (1) the header of the CSV file, and (2) rows for students who had done more problems would be longer than the first row, thus creating skew, and mis-alining data within columns.  This has caused the wrong grades to be produced, by instructors using raw grades data.\r\n\r\nThe culprit is this line in the `get_student_grade_summary_data` function:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/lms/djangoapps/instructor/views/legacy.py#L1171\r\n\r\nThe fix is to do two passes through the grades, generating an in-memory collection of the grades data, from which the list of assignments and the grades are then assembled.\r\n\r\nThis feature is valuable to instructors who wish to download raw grades, either for double-checking the edX platform's arcane grading configuration, or for computing grades based on their own algorithms.   It is widely employed in courses at MIT employing the edX platform.\r\n\r\nThis PR is being provided for other organizations running the edX platform for residential use.  It is hoped that a future revision of the entire grading code will properly address such problems.

When those commands stabilize, a future PR will update and merge the Paver commands for these tasks from #2146 .\r\n\r\nIn consultation with folks from the LMS, Studio, and Doc teams, I have been more aggressive about deprecating unused commands.  In particular, this PR goes further than #2146 by deprecating:\r\n\r\n* Asset watchers (there are plans to add a new system soon to implement this functionality)\r\n* Showing documentation in a web browser (the docs team doesn\'t use it)\r\n* Running Celery workers with Studio settings (Studio doesn\'t currently have Celery tasks)\r\n* Course management commands (setting staff bits, importing courses, etc.)  Studio team uses manage.py directly for this.\r\n\r\nI have also taken the opportunity to replace "cms" in the Paver commands with "studio", on the assumption that this will be easier for open-source contributors.  I have not changed the manage.py commands, so this shouldn\'t have an operational impact.  In particular, the `gather_assets` rake task (used by deploy scripts) still accepts "cms" and works correctly.\r\n\r\nI have verified that this branch successfully deploys to a sandbox both with and without Stanford-style theming, without requiring changes to the configuration scripts.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @dglance for taking on this enormous task!

The reason was that seekTo() could not start playing a video from a point that hasn't been buffered yet.\r\n\r\n**Reproducing the bug**\r\nUse Firefox to reproduce this bug.\r\n\r\n1.) Create a new unit in Studio.\r\n2.) Add two videos. One should have Video URL set to http://youtu.be/OEoXaMPEzfM and the other should have Video URL set to http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.webm .\r\n3.) For each video, set the start time to 00:00:10, and the end time to 00:00:30 .\r\n4.) Try playing both of them. Observe that the YouTube video starts playing from 00:00:00, even though the start-end range is displayed correctly.

2314,'',"Cache course location translations\n@ormsbee @chrisndodge @cpennington Ok, now this is ready to review. Sorry for the not quite ready version yesterday. After 24h of game jam development on the small mac screen, my eyes weren't working well enough. This one is against release as it should be.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the mongo db queries for accessing 6.002 from around 1100 on courseware page to 7. I still want to keep has_access from querying for instructor and staff access until it's failed on the student access query. I also want to perhaps memoize the ...Role() instantiation as it has no dependency on request nor user just course.\r\n\r\nI have unit tests for the translate_location_to_course_locator on master. I could pull those over as well. This version differs from master in that this uses caching whereas the one on master explicitly says it shouldn't (I hadn't thought of using this approach).\r\n\r\nAs to query count unit tests, we should discuss w/ @wedaly and others b/c it involves reconfiguring middleware and will make the tests a lot slower. I think we may want to do a separate suite of perf tests which use query counting only for the perf tests."

I copied the file into our repo, because since it generates display strings, we want to add these strings to our I18N workflow. Also I needed to extend it to expose some method decorators to allow for test setting overrides.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is for new account creation only. It appears we are using some standard Django workflow/controllers for Password Reset use-cases, so I'm not seeing how to tie in these concepts with this 'out-of-the-box' approach currently in use. We'll need to be able to do the same enforcement on password reset flows.\r\n\r\n@antoviaque do you want to do a quick eyeball on this before I send this along to others? The new decorators I added seem to be very similar, but I'm not quite adept at decorators to refactor these into a nice base-class to make it a bit more DRY."

2123,'',"Microsites\n@chrisndodge has submitted pull request #2061 for the microsites feature, which is apparently on a tight deadline to be merged by Monday. I took a look at that pull request, and I have several concerns about the architecture of that solution. Since Chris has been crazy busy lately, I decided to create a new branch, working off of his, to try to show what I believe to be a better architecture. The main differences are:\r\n\r\n* #2061 creates a new middleware (common/djangoapps/microsite_configuration/middleware.py) that runs at the start and end of every single request, whether the request is for a page that would be modified by the presence of a microsite or not. This pull request replaces that middleware with a set of functions (common/djangoapps/student/microsites.py) that are called wherever microsite information is necessary, so there are some requests that don't ever call it.\r\n\r\n* Because the middleware ran at the start and end of every request, it was possible to set information on and read information from the MicrositeConfiguration object at any time -- and #2061 takes full advantage of that, treating it as a global variable. It was very difficult to trace where the information on that object comes from, where it is modified, and so on. By contrast, because there is no global object in this PR, it's easier to trace the logic of where the microsite information comes from.\r\n\r\n* #2061 defines an `enable_microsites()` function in a settings file, which must be run after all of the microsite logic is defined in that same file -- which makes it almost impossible to cleanly change or reorder the microsite settings without also looking at every single place where that function is called. This PR moves that function into `lms/startup.py`, which is called *after* all the settings logic is completed, so that we don't need to worry about ordering of the settings.\r\n\r\n* #2061 has a very verbose, layered API: a `MicrositeConfiguration` object with a `get_microsite_configuration_value()` class method, that wraps a Python dict. I've removed this API entirely, so that the Python dict is available, with stardard indexing and `get()` syntax, which is much more familiar, concise, and readable.\r\n\r\n* #2061 defines the microsite settings as a dictionary of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of a directory on disk, and the value is another dict that has configuration information for the microsite. My PR is similar, but rather than the key being the name of a directory, it is the subdomain where the microsite is available: that way, you can't define overlapping microsite subdomains, and you *can* define two domains that point to the same microsite (like mit.edx.org and mitx.edx.org).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I haven't been able to test this at all, because I haven't gotten the microsite assets that Chris has been using to test his branch. However, I believe the code is more concise, more readable, and more maintainable, and I'd like to at least have other developers compare the the two pull requests, so that whatever goes in has a decent code review."

2014,'','Fix (re-implement) answer distribution report generation.\nThis restores functionality that has been broken since the introduction of\r\nXModuleDescriptor/XModule proxying (part of the XBlock transition). It generates\r\na CSV of all answers for all content of type "problem" in a given course, with a\r\nrow per (problem part, answer). The format is:\r\n\r\nurl_name, display name, answer id, answer, count\r\n\r\nExample values:\r\n  url_name = "7f1b1523a55848cd9f5c93eb8cbabcf7"\r\n  display name = "Problem 1: Something Hard"\r\n  answer id = i4x-JediAcdmy-LTSB304-problem-7f1b1523a55848cd9f5c93eb8cbabcf7_2_1\r\n  answer = "Use the Force"\r\n  count = 1138\r\n\r\nSince it only grabs things of type "problem", it will not return results for\r\nthings like self/peer-assessments. Any Loncapa problem types will show up (so\r\nmultiple choice, text input, numeric, etc.)\r\n\r\nInstead of crawling the course tree and instantiating the appropriate CapaModule\r\nobjects to grab state, this version draws directly from StudentModule. This lets\r\nus skip a lot of processing and most importantly lets us generate the answer\r\ndistribution without causing side-effects (since XBlocks auto-save state). It\r\nalso lets us take advantage of a read-replica database if one is available, to\r\nminimize locking concerns.\r\n\r\nThere are minor changes to the legacy dashboard around CSV charset encoding and\r\na change to OptionResponseXMLFactory to make it more unicode friendly. Answer\r\ndistribution output is now also sorted, to group together answers for the same\r\ncontent piece.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not introduce celery into the process. Answer distributions\r\nare still only available for small courses.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this introduces slight changes in output CSV file. First, it sorts the\r\nCSV output by url_name. Second, it will now count the answers of people who have\r\nunenrolled from the course (previously, those entries were omitted).\r\n\r\nThis was originally created to fix [LMS-922], but it also addresses [LMS-811] and\r\npossibly other areas in the legacy dashboard where CSV downloads break due to\r\ncharacter encoding issues.'

Currently, the system only allows feedback blurbs that correspond to the correct answer. Targeted feedback will show up without the student needing to click the "Show Answer" button. There is also an option to change the explanation for the correct choice from a solution to targeted feedback. This essentially means that a student will see this automatically without clicking any buttons, and will also not see a green checkmark next to the correct answer until pressing the "Show Answer" button.\r\n\r\nTo try out, you set up a multiple choice problem with attribute `targeted-feedback` set to any value, or to always show the correct solution without the student needing to press a button or see the correct choice, set the value to `alwaysShowCorrectChoiceExplanation`. Then, you can provide targeted feedback by including a `<targetedfeedback>` element within a parent `<targetedfeedbackset>` element.

Meaning that the purchased income actually goes into their account from CyberSource.  This also means that med school accountants need to be able to access the itemized purchased data from our platform (since CyberSource HOP can\'t itemize).\r\n\r\nWe agreed that the easiest way is for us to provide a page in the platfrom from which they can download CSV reports that itemize purchases made over a time range.  There\'s no link to this page anywhere in the platform.  They\'ll just have to bookmark it.  The access control for this link is done by a magic `django.contrib.auth.models.Group`, whose name is set in settings.\r\n\r\nThey also had one "special" requirement, that each itemized line be annotated with a "PTA" number, which is a direct 1-to-1 mapping to the `course_id` of the purchased `PaidCourseRegistration`.  (Yes, I suggested that they could simply match up the description with a PTA number.  No, somehow they weren\'t comfortable with that).  This leads to the need for the new `PaidCourseRegistrationAnnotation` model.\r\n'

When the last transcript line is read by the screen reader, and the video ends, nothing happens to inform the user that the video ended.\r\n\r\n<b>Solution</b>\r\nWhen the video ends (either on end time, or at the end), the `title` attribute of the time slider knob is set to `video ended`. The knob is brought into focus for the screenreader to read out the title attribute. Because the know is the first element to get focus when the user is tabbing through video controls, upon further tabbing, the next element in line after the know is the play button. When the video starts playing again, the `title` attribute is reset back to `video position`.\r\n\r\n<b>Reviewers</b>\r\n- @wedaly '

The shuffling uses the problem\'s seed.\r\nThe added syntax for the xml and markdown is documented in the Changelog.\r\n\r\nOne concern was: will this mess up analytics?\r\nMy experiments suggest that analytics will work fine:\r\n\r\nThe question is -- when the question choices are displayed shuffled, is enough logged so that analytics still works?\r\n\r\nI have a 4-option problem with shuffling enabled. In this case, the options are presented in the order b a d c (i.e. 1 0 3 2). I selected option c, the last one displayed (which happens to be correct), and then looking in courseware_studentmodulehistory I have the following row\r\n\r\n2013-10-22 22:23:40.658495|1.0|1.0|{"correct_map": {"i4x-Stanford-CS99-problem-408c0fcffb8c41ec87675d8c3f7a3b5b_2_1": {"hint": "", "hintmode": null, "correctness": "correct", "npoints": null, "msg": "", "queuestate": null}}, "input_state": {"i4x-Stanford-CS99-problem-408c0fcffb8c41ec87675d8c3f7a3b5b_2_1": {}}, "attempts": 2, "seed": 282, "done": true, "student_answers": {"i4x-Stanford-CS99-problem-408c0fcffb8c41ec87675d8c3f7a3b5b_2_1": "choice_2"}}||4|52\r\n\r\nIn student_answers I see choice_2 which is "c" in the 0-based numbering, so that\'s right. It looks to me that it has successfully recorded which choice I made, not getting confused by the fact that the options where displayed in a different order. The rest of the stuff in the rows looks reasonable, but mostly it\'s greek to me.\r\n\r\nBecause we\'re using standard python shuffle, knowing the seed, you can recreate the shuffle order. Maybe you never need to do this since the problem will just do it for you. Still. Noting that the logged seed above is 282:\r\n\r\n>>> r = random.Random(282)\r\n>>> a = [0, 1, 2, 3]\r\n>>> r.shuffle(a)\r\n>>> a\r\n[1, 0, 3, 2]\r\n\r\nCute!\r\n'

This resolves the bug noted above, but is far from ideal. Given that the LMS Sass architecture (the individual files, the inheritance/dependency within them, and the unorganized styling across the app), I could not find a logical/semantic way to segment the application.scss (generated by application.scss.mako for alpha-level theming reasons). Thus the separate CSS files are suffixed with -extend1 and -extend2.\r\n2. Also, there is a ton of redundancy where each application(-extend*).css file is calling the same Sass set-up files, generating redundant styling rules that are already cached in its sibling files (essentially, we're making the browser load/parse a subset of the same rules in two separate stylesheets - not great at all).\r\n\r\nThese two points really concern me and I highly recommend a very deep revamp/cleaning of the Sass architecture shortly. I've tested the display of many pages locally, but each page's display should really be stress-tested to ensure there are no visual regressions. If you want to test the number of rules being used, crack open your console and run this gist in a view - https://gist.github.com/psebborn/1885511\r\n\r\n**Per Rob/Miki, its been decided to merge this change into the release branch.**"

This resolves the bug noted above, but is far from ideal. Given that the LMS Sass architecture (the individual files, the inheritance/dependency within them, and the unorganized styling across the app), I could not find a logical/semantic way to segment the application.scss (generated by application.scss.mako for alpha-level theming reasons). Thus the separate CSS files are suffixed with -extend1 and -extend2.\r\n2. Also, there is a ton of redundancy where each application(-extend*).css file is calling the same Sass set-up files, generating redundant styling rules that are already cached in its sibling files (essentially, we're making the browser load/parse a subset of the same rules in two separate stylesheets - not great at all).\r\n\r\nThese two points really concern me and I highly recommend a very deep revamp/cleaning of the Sass architecture shortly. I've tested the display of many pages locally, but each page's display should really be stress-tested to ensure there are no visual regressions. If you want to test the number of rules being used, crack open your console and run this gist in a view - https://gist.github.com/psebborn/1885511\r\n\r\n**Per Rob/Miki, its been decided to merge this change into the release branch.**"

I set the timeout much higher (30 seconds) to improve stability -- if the video appears sooner, the test won't wait the full 30 seconds.  I don't know why the video is taking so long to load, but in the short term, I think this is a reasonable solution.\r\n\r\nThis also adds retry logic to the creation of a new video component.  I've observed that occasionally clicking the new video component immediately after the page loads doesn't work (I've tested it manually, and the delay is small enough that users would never notice).  Adding an explicit world.wait() is unreliable and inefficient, so I've added retry logic that clicks again if the video doesn't appear immediately.  Again, not ideal, but it should improve stability.\r\n\r\nReviewer: @auraz "
1232,'','Fix navigation and grading acceptance tests\nCurrently, master has three acceptance tests that fail nondeterministically.  This PR fixes two of them: navigation.feature (in the LMS) and grading.feature (in Studio).\r\n\r\n* The grading test was clicking the "section," then immediately clicking the subsection without waiting for the menu opening animation to complete.  I added an explicit wait to ensure that the subsection is clickable.\r\n\r\n* The grading test was using world.wait(0.5) to ensure that the "Save" notification was clickable.  Selenium always reports the save button as clickable because it is hidden and shown using CSS transformations.  I replaced the Selenium click with a JavaScript-triggered event.  This is slightly less valid (since we\'re not actually clicking the button) but much more reliable, so I think the tradeoff makes sense.\r\n\r\nI also fixed various style violations and simplified navigation.py.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to get this merged soon so we can get better stability in the cluster.\r\n\r\nReviewer: @singingwolfboy'

This resolves the bug noted above, but is far from ideal. Given that the LMS Sass architecture (the individual files, the inheritance/dependency within them, and the unorganized styling across the app), I could not find a logical/semantic way to segment the application.scss (generated by application.scss.mako for alpha-level theming reasons). Thus the separate CSS files are suffixed with -extend1 and -extend2.\r\n2. Also, there is a ton of redundancy where each application(-extend*).css file is calling the same Sass set-up files, generating redundant styling rules that are already cached in its sibling files (essentially, we're making the browser load/parse a subset of the same rules in two separate stylesheets - not great at all).\r\n\r\nThese two points really concern me and I highly recommend a very deep revamp/cleaning of the Sass architecture shortly. I've tested the display of many pages locally, but each page's display should really be stress-tested to ensure there are no visual regressions.

This will allow me to correctly shard the tests in the Jenkins cluster.\r\n\r\n@jzoldak '

This obviously creates a place where anonymous_student_id is linked with non-anonymous student email, causing a de-anonymization risk, but our faculty need to get students\' email when they write graders that pull from xqueue.

Moves the rest of the JavaScript in assets.js to the HTML page so that the functions do not have to be global and the "Upload File" action can access the Backbone view.\r\n3. Fixes some rendering bugs with the file upload dialog (especially for 2nd and subsequent uploads on the page with no page reloads in-between). There was a method in base.js (markAsLoaded) that was never being called because the condition was never met, so I deleted that as well.\r\n4. Deletes assets.py assets_to_json_dict method, which was not being used.\r\n5. The beginning of a restful interface for updating assets-- right now only the Delete is implemented.\r\n\r\nAcceptance tests are passing.\r\n\r\n@dmitchell @singingwolfboy Please review.\r\n\r\n@jkarni I can talk over the changes related to the asset upload dialog with you. I noticed that in startUpload, files.length was 0 for any upload after the 1st (until the page was refreshed).

887,'','Add embedded video clips to open ended responses\nIn order to improve student engagement, this pull request allows course staff to enable embedded video clips in open end responses, giving students more expressive power. This is the first step towards higher video engagement. Instead of passively watching videos, students must think critically to determine which snippets illustrate their point. This provides students with captivating experiences and clearer responses for the course staff. Consider film or theater classes. With this tool, course staff could ask questions about scenes, movies, or other recordings, and students could reply naturally with precise clips as explanations.\r\n\r\nIn the future, such rich descriptions would not be limited to questions and prompts. It is our hope that this tool will lead to video annotation so that students can build multimedia notebooks capturing their key take aways. Not only would this be beneficial to students, but it would provide new insights to course staff about what students actually take away from their classes.\r\n\r\nTo enable the video clipper, the course staff needs to specify a Youtube ID in the settings for the open ended response question. This will generate a snippet button allowing students to select in and out points for their video clips through a modal window.\r\n\r\nThis addition is done almost entirely in coffeescript with very minimal changes to the combined open ended module python code and html.  The majority of the video clipper is contained in a single coffeescript file, which has two classes: VideoClipper and OmniPlayer. VideoClipper generates html and handles user interactions, while OmniPlayer abstracts away video player specifics for VideoClipper. Currently, Omniplayer only works with YouTube, but additional players, including the edx player, can be added with small additions to OmniPlayer requiring no further changes to the VideoClipper class. \r\n\r\nSome modifications were made to display.coffee for the combined open ended module to set up and remove VideoClipper as needed. To integrate VideoClipper into staff grading, a single call to VideoClipper.generate needed to be made when the problem data was loaded by staff_grading.coffee.\r\n\r\nEnabling video response\r\n![open response settings](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100422/f45de1c0-175a-11e3-9b86-fa42ab363d3b.png)\r\n\r\nView in Studio\r\n![view in studio](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100424/f4622546-175a-11e3-95c4-66748b4a4d5e.png)\r\n\r\nClip creation\r\n![clip creation](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100419/f4540e52-175a-11e3-83fe-fee3e1193337.png)\r\n\r\nStudent response\r\n![student response](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100421/f45d6b46-175a-11e3-88fc-9e2f8f8b748d.png)\r\n\r\nStaff grading\r\n![staff grading](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100420/f45e6622-175a-11e3-917e-73eceeff78eb.png)\r\n\r\nVideo cliper viewer\r\n![video clip viewer](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/549702/1100423/f45fbc52-175a-11e3-95d2-d2f7d23654f7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

So if you make a submission and it is a duplicate, you will have to wait for up to 30 minutes for a grade to come back, and have no warning of what is happening.\r\n\r\nStaff have expressed some frustration over this, because it results in them submitting something, going to the staff grading view, and not seeing anything to grade.

You can now run JS tests without starting up Django!\r\n\r\n* All tests run in Firefox.  This will allow us to test HTML5 functionality (e.g. VideoAlpha).  js-test-tool uses Selenium to run the tests, so we can change this to any WebDriver-compatible browser in the future.\r\n\r\n* Video tests have been enabled and are passing in Firefox.  (They do not pass in Chrome yet, still need to figure out why.)\r\n\r\n* XML coverage information is reported for all source files in `reports/javascript/coverage.xml`.  The package is set to "javascript" so we can filter just JS coverage in Jenkins.  Support for HTML reports (showing which lines are covered/uncovered) will be added in a future PR.\r\n\r\n* Diff-cover now generates one report for all Python and JavaScript.\r\n\r\n* js-test-tool provides a "developer" mode specifically for writing and debugging the test suite.  This will load the tests into your default browser and continue serving the test pages until you terminate the tool.\r\n\r\nNew commands:\r\n\r\n    # Run all JavaScript tests and print results the the console\r\n    rake test:js\r\n\r\n    # Run all JavaScript tests and collect coverage information\r\n    rake test:js:coverage\r\n\r\n    # Run the JavaScript tests in your default browser\r\n    rake test:js:dev[lms]\r\n    rake test:js:dev[cms]\r\n    rake test:js:dev[common]\r\n    rake test:js:dev[xmodule]\r\n\r\n    # Run the JavaScript tests and print results to the console\r\n    rake test:js:run[lms]\r\n    rake test:js:run[cms]\r\n    rake test:js:run[common]\r\n    rake test:js:run[xmodule]\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who gave feedback in https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/677\r\n@valera-rozuvan @jzoldak Am I good to merge?'

Students may thus see modules disappear from the Edge server, while it is being edited.\r\n\r\nInstead of using Edge, at MIT we are exporting content from Studio, and importing this into an LMS (with mongo modulestore).  Studio users are presented with a "Push to LMS" page, via which they can initiate an export from Studio to github.  The export goes to the `giturl` with which the course is configured.  The github instance can then be configured with a web hook to trigger the LMS to pull the repo and update.\r\n\r\nStudio authors only see this option if the string `"allow_push_to_lms"` is in the `advanced_modules` settings list.\r\n\r\nThis workflow has the added advantage that a history of student-facing changes is recorded in github each time content is pushed to the LMS from Studio.\r\n\r\nThis feature is enabled by `MITX_FEATURES[\'ENABLE_PUSH_TO_LMS\']=True`'

I want to get a preliminary look at it to hopefully avoid the time sink of going through multiple jenkins iterations.  If nothing is changed on jenkins or the environment variables are not set, the default behavior remains.\r\n\r\nThis is everything that is needed to allow our acceptance tests to connect to sauce labs and to run the tests in a matrix of browsers.  In order to do this, the following was added:\r\n\r\n1. browser.py will now check the settings to see if it is a sauce connection and will properly set up the desired capabilities.  If sauce is not enabled, the tests will proceed as normal.  Also, the functionality to update the pass/fail status on sauce is included.\r\n\r\n2. The settings are obtained through environment variables that are sent hopefully through jenkins.  It is also important to note that sauce can only be connected to on a small list of ports.  In keeping with the idea of having a random port (so acceptance and unit tests do not clash), the acceptance tests will choose a random port from this list.\r\n\r\nIn order to utilize sauce properly, the following variables must be set by jenkins\r\nSAUCE_ENABLED : true if using sauce\r\nSAUCE_USER_NAME, SAUCE_API_KEY : credentials for accesing sauce\r\nSAUCE_PLATFORM, SAUCE_BROWSER, SAUCE_VERSION: specifications for what sauce is running\r\nSAUCE_DEVICE only applies to one set of sauce configurations and doesn't need to be configured\r\nThe build name will correspond to the git commit hash found through JOB_NAME\r\n\r\n3. Some tests are known to not work in Sauce or on specific browsers, those scenarios are annotated with tags so they can be skipped.\r\n\r\n4.  test_acceptance.sh was changed so that if sauce or a browser type is specified, it will skip all of the tests that do not work on sauce or that browser type. \r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, we should be able to specify what browser we want jenkins to run acceptance tests under.  Acceptance.py will now take either the environment variable 'LETTUCE_BROWSER' or use a default of 'chrome'.  This is so there can be jobs for multiple browsers that do not need to run through sauce and can be configured easily.  test_acceptance.sh also reflects this by also allowing the possibility to skip tests based on this variable"

You can now run JS tests without starting up Django!\r\n\r\n* All tests run in Firefox.

The package is set to "javascript" so we can filter just JS coverage in Jenkins.  Support for HTML reports (showing which lines are covered/uncovered) will be added in a future PR.\r\n\r\n* Diff-cover now generates one report for all Python and JavaScript.  This is in a different location than Jenkins expects, so we\'ll need to update the Jenkins jobs once this gets merged (currently, it will show 404\'s if you look at diff coverage for this PR)\r\n\r\n* js-test-tool provides a "developer" mode specifically for writing and debugging the test suite.

To run,\r\nuse the following:\r\n\r\nrake django-admin[anonymized_id_mapping,<system>,<env>,<course_id>]\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, substitute the appropriate values for <system>, <env>,\r\nand <course_id>.

662,'','requirejs in Studio\nThis branch properly integrates [requirejs](http://www.requirejs.org/) into the Studio codebase. Requirejs does away with attaching Javascript functions and classes to a global namespace, and instead forces JS files to declare their dependencies at the top of the file. For example, if a file uses jQuery, it will start with `require(["jquery"], function($) {` -- you can see that rather than jQuery being bound to the global `$` variable, it\'s passed into the file as a local `$` variable. It\'s a convention that works surprisingly well, and although this pull request has a lot of code changes, most of them were pretty simple and quick to implement.\r\n\r\nWe can also use requirejs as an optimizer, loading together requirements bundles before the code goes into production so that any given page only needs to dynamically load one JS file -- and that JS file will contain only the code that the page needs. Requirejs also allows for easier unit testing, since you can load and test a given file in isolation. Requirejs also enforces a more modular coding style, requiring only one JS class per file, and encouraging an understandable file layout in the project.\r\n\r\nCaveats in this pull request: this PR is focused on the Studio code, and I haven\'t tested this with the LMS at all -- there are a few files outside of the `cms` namespace that I had to touch, but I figured that we can deal with the fallout of that if and when we decide to move forward with this approach. In addition, due to the way that XModule dynamically assigns arbitrary MD5-based names to its JS files, the XModule JS is currently incompatible with requirejs. I\'ve created a wrapper script around all the XModule JS files, so that when any other script requires the XModule JS, *all* the XModule JS files are dynamically loaded.\r\n\r\nPlease review the code, comment, ask questions, and learn about how requirejs works -- it\'s generally considered to be an excellent pattern for managing a large amount of Javascript.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: even though git says that thousands of lines of code have changed in this pull request, it\'s actually much less than that. Most of the changes are due to splitting up files that defined multiple classes and re-indenting existing files.'

652,'','Enable mongodb to be used as back-end for git-based authoring workflow\nMIT authors have largely preferred to use the "github+LMS" workflow instead of Studio.  In the github+LMS workflow, course authors do their work on a git repository; when changes are pushed, a webhook (on github) automatically triggers the LMS to reload XML course content from github, via a "gitreload".\r\n\r\nThis workflow has enabled MIT authors to employ many advanced features which are inaccessible from Studio.  It also allows large course teams, with many authors, to avoid stepping on each other, and to take advantage of social coding and network effects arising from using github.  It also lets course teams keep track of multiple revisions, to revert mistaken changes, and to use one repository for multiple course branches.  It also allows researchers to track the entire history of course content changes, eg so that if mistakes in a midterm exam are corrected, this is recorded in the git repo logs, and can be reconciled with records of student responses.\r\n\r\nThe downside has been that loading XML files into the bare, non-mongo LMS is painful.  Each thread of an LMS must load all the XML into memory.  This causes the LMS to take a long time to restart, when many courses are loaded.  It can also lead to inconsistencies between LMS responses, when the threads of an LMS hold different versions of XML content in memory.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is to replace the memory-backed LMS with a mongo-backed LMS, in the github based workflow.  This new "git+edge" workflow, or "git+mongoLMS" workflow, then has all the benefits of github\'s social coding, together with the benefits of using a central database backend for the LMS instances.  \r\n\r\nThis solution has been in discussion since the spring of 2013 (re email with @ormsbee), and many of the needed pieces have been put in place since then.  The last remaining issue has been the fact that certain content, ie script code stored in libraries, and static content stored hierarchically, get lost or loose hierarchy, when imported into mongo.  Also, when a course has a large amount of static content, it is very inefficient to reload all of this into the mongodb each time an author makes a minor change (eg 8.02x, which has many GB of static content associated with its TEAL simulations).\r\n\r\nThis PR puts in a last piece needed to make the "git+mongoLMS" workflow possible and functional.  It does this by circumventing the database for static and code content.  Specifically, it adds the ability to import course content (into CMS / edge) without static content, and without rewriting static links.  It changes xml_importer.py and import.py to introduce `static_asset_path` as an LMS namespace metadata variable, which is used to determine if static links should be rewritten (as `c4x://...`) or left alone.  The import command now takes a `--nostatic` flag on the command line, to indicate when this should be done.\r\n\r\nWith this change, and by configuring nginx to look in course /static directories for individual course static content, the "git+mongoLMS" workflow is enabled.  To enable code to work, course repo directories are symlinked to the course number directories \r\n\r\nThis PR is now in use in the production residential MITx systems at MIT.\r\n\r\nNo tests are provided -- pending discussion and comments.'

This involved changing the css selector and can be applied to chrome\r\n* Notification bars could not be clicked through the webdriver so instead they are clicked through javascript on firefox\r\n* A function called is_firefox() was added that will return if the browser_driver name is 'firefox' allowing for some specific solutions / skipping based on browser\r\n* Firefox will not trigger certain events through the webdriver, thus the function trigger_event was added.  This will trigger a jquery event on the given selector.  By default, it triggers the 'change' event on index 0.  This was helpful in getting certain input fields to update properly.  This function should be avoided when possible.\r\n* Code Mirror will now work on firefox, this was done by forcibly blurring the codemirror field\r\n* Certain things could not be clicked or touched by firefox because they were underneath other elements.  On firefox, they are made visible through javascript\r\n* Some small changes were made to the code so that less needed to be different between firefox and chrome.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThese tests were verified to still work with the latest version of chrome and chrome driver.  The version of firefox that was tested was 22.0 and 23.0.  The tests were run on both ubuntu and mac OS with the same results\r\n\r\nOne other major issue is that firefox will not fire certain events if firefox is not the active window.  As far as I know, this will only affect the LaTex scenario in problem-editor.feature, the testing automatic quoting in advanced-settings.feature and some of the video alpha tests.  Splinter will start the firefox browser as the active window.  However, this means that it needs to remain the active window making testing a pain due to not being able to run in the background.  Also, this will have implications on running multiple acceptance tests in parallel on firefox as only one of them can be in the foreground.\r\n\r\nWhen this is ready to be merged, I would like to run this branch once in jenkins to verifiy that I did not introduce anything as this is a larger pull request.\r\n\r\nAS OF LATE:\r\nThe only errors in the test suite for firefox are in the following features:\r\ncms/checklists.feature - due to firefox not being able to make links active afftecting those two scenarios\r\nlms/login.feature - due to firefox having a weird redirect issue only when the whole suite is run\r\nlms/signup.feature - due to firefox having a weird redirect issue only when the whole suite is run"

In Studio location.name is always a GUID and therefore can be assumed to be unique.\r\n\r\nThis shortcut get\'s rewritten at LMS rendering time, using the same get_html() wrappers that /static/ and /course/ shortcuts use.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a small change in the edit Unit page where we removed that useless display of the /course/aaa/bbb.

In light of conversations with Mark and Victor, I\'ve also refactored my previous integration of Segment.io. We now call the API directly (instead of through the Logger), and the events have proper names and well-named fields.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I\'ve added the ability to track which tab/page an instructor is on in the current instructor dashboard, as requested by Mark and Victor. This wasn\'t possible before since the URL doesn\'t change. Miles\' refactor will require a forced "page load" count using Segment.io\'s `pageview` method, but this will allow us to track instructor navigation behavior before then.'

I have run it ~10-15 times and haven't gotten any breaks so at the very worst, it is no less flakey than what we have.\r\n\r\nThese commits should fix the flakey tests outlined above.  This was accomplished by making the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. The problem: There was a flakey test in checking the text of the show/hide answer button\r\n    The proposed theory: It was checking the text of the button too quickly.\r\n    The proposed fix: I changed the show answer text to instead assert if the text is present or not.  While this widens the scope of search, it was the most reliable way of adding in the implicit wait time that splinter allows.\r\n\r\n2. The problem: Two of the navigation tests involving clicking a section were failing\r\n    The proposed theory: During the jQuery accordion animation, the element is findable but not clickable thus we need to wait.\r\n    The proposed fix: jQuery changes the class of the active part of the accordian.  Now the css is using these extra classes/attributes so selenium should only be attempting to click the element when it is indeed active and ready\r\n\r\n3. The problem: A random stale element reference exception when checking a multiple choice box\r\n    The proposed theory: Not sure besides just weird flakiness with stale elements and I haven't ever reproduced this\r\n    The proposed fix: A new function called css_check that works exactly like css_click except with checking a box instead of clicking.  This allows for the introduction of retrying when there is this exception.  As such, inputfield now returns a css selector that can be passed into css_check instead of a web element."

CMS tests now pull from their own contentstore database.  This mirrors the behavior of how cms interacts with the modulestore databse and allows for it to be refreshed upon each scenario.\r\n\r\n2. Upload\r\nThis tests the file uploading page.  These tests mostly cover uploading a file and making sure if the same file is uploaded twice, it only appears once.  At the moment, it was not feasible to be able to download a file, access it, and clean up at the end during the test.  This would allow for making sure the download / update worked by checking the hash of the file.\r\n\r\n3. Course Team\r\nThe ability to add and remove other users to the course team was tested.  When another user is added, they can then access the course in their studio.  Also, it is not possible to add a user who does not exist.  Lastly, the added user is not able to add or delete other users.  I also changed the common.py such that the course name/org/number are constants that can be changed at the top of the file and also allows for other tests to import those names.\r\n\r\n4. Static Pages\r\nThe ability to add, delete and edit static pages was tested.  Also, ostensibly, the sortability was tested.  As of this pull request, selenium does not interact well with jQuery Sortable items.  Thus, I had to introduce a somewhat hack in order to at least gain the visual affects of sorting.  However, it is very fragile upon refreshing the page, the order does not necessarily propagate.  This is due to the amount of events that sorting fires during the moving process and the difficulty in manually firing all of the dependent events.  This method was also added to the world such that it could be possible to test reordering in other places.  It takes the css class of the items, the 2 indicies, and the css class of the sortable table/thing.\r\n\r\n5. Course Updates/Handouts\r\nThe ability to add/delete/edit course updates was tested as well as the ability to update the dates of the updates and the ability to change the handouts.\r\n\r\nHopefully, with these new testing features, every page of studio is now tested.  The only known thing that isn't tested is drag and drop / sortability of subsections and sections.  This is due to the aforementioned issue with drag and drop as well as when I manually tested it, it was a bit buggy."

The Vagrantfile at the root handles the vagrant commands like `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\nProvisioning is done by the shell script `vagrant-provisionning.sh`, which is a light wrapper around the `create-dev-setup.sh` which does most of the job using the standard process, but limiting possible side-effect by ensuring the environment on which the install is performed is clean.\r\n\r\nBased on an Ubuntu precise 12.04 LTS. See details in the README on how to use.\r\n\r\nOther fixes included with this patch, which were necessary to either fix issues with the current install script, or allow it to complete in the context of Vagrant shell provisioning:\r\n* Fix install script freeze (syncdb superuser account creation): Since the output is passed through tee, when the django admin asks the user if he would like to create a super user account, it blocks the install, without even showing the question. Disabled interactivity for syncdb.\r\n* Fix use of DEBIAN_FRONTEND: Before executing a command, for security reasons `sudo` clears the environment, so the value of DEBIAN_FRONTEND was never passed to apt-get. This was causing the mysql packqge to still prompt for a value interactively.\r\n* Improves ruby/rvm install by directly installing the right version: The script used to download the latest version of ruby through rvm, then later on install the one used by the project. Now we directly download the version of the project when rvm is installed.\r\n* Options "-q" (quiet), "-n" (no pull), "-y" (non interactive): Added several options to the `create-dev-env.sh` script to improve its ability to be used by another script:\r\n** -y -- non interactive mode (no prompt, proceed immediately)\r\n** -n -- do not attempt to pull edx-platform\r\n** -q -- be more quiet (removes info at beginning & end)\r\n* Make curl options more consistent, add logging of errors: The options passed to curl were not always the same - added logging of error (-S) everywhere (was only used for Mac before) and made it quiet in the rare few cases where it wasn\'t yet (-s).\r\n* Make `apt-get` and `mkvirtualenv` output log friendly: Added options to make the output of `apt-get` and `mkvirtualenv` friendlier to getting logged. This allows to be more easily recorded in log files or when the install is performed through utilities - like Vagrant.\r\n* Also included "create-dev-env.sh: if run from repo, set $BASE appropriately" from Yarko - cf https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/32'

This is the one that should be merged.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n------------\r\nThis is based on [last week\'s conversation](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform-pre-clean/pull/2135), and it is the branch that I\'d like to be pulled into `master`. This is a companion to @caesar2164\'s changes in #28 in that both are needed for Stanford\'s 6/11/13 launch. (We\'re in the process of putting together one branch combining both PRs so that you can review/pull it all at once, if you so choose.)\r\n\r\nAs we talked about in the RFC PR in the pre-clean repo, this PR is not a work of art. There are a number of ugly conditionals and hacks that are both Stanford- and edX-specific. However, the idea is that a compromise for now will get us living on `master` and better able to turn this into a full-blown theming layer in the near future. I have tried to pull things out into the settings where possible, but there are a few places (e.g., the `lms/templates/emails/`) where some Stanford-specific hacking was needed to get the desired language in place.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------\r\nFirst, you\'ll need to grab our theme files, located in a public repo at https://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme. We\'ve established a convention that theme files will live outside of the main edx-platform repository, in the `edx_base/themes/<theme-name>` (or `mitx_all/themes/<theme-name>`) directory. To grab the Stanford theme, assuming you\'re inside your repository dir (`edx-platform/`), run:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ..\r\n    $ mkdir themes\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme.git themes/stanford\r\n\r\nProbably the most obnoxious part of themes is that *both* Django and Rake need to know:\r\n\r\n1. whether or not a theme is enabled\r\n2. what the theme\'s name is (since that tells them where to look for templates, static files, etc.)\r\n\r\nDjango needs to know for obvious reasons (adjusting settings like `STATICFILES_DIRS`, `MAKO_TEMPLATES`, etc. and for rendering templates appropriately), and Rake needs to know because it controls static asset compilation. If a theme is enabled, we need to conditionally import the theme\'s Sass overrides into the main LMS Sass files (`lms/static/sass/{application,course}.scss`), and we need to set the Sass compiler\'s load and watch paths appropriately so that the theme\'s Sass files are included in compilation. Unfortunately, [Sass does not support conditional imports](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import), so we instead turn the main LMS Sass files into Mako templates, and use Mako to control the conditional theme import. This Mako invocation is something that must also be done by the Rakefile, since it must be done before the Sass compiler runs. ~~Right now, this is one nasty hack in `assets.rake`, but #5 does this in a much better fashion.~~ (#5 is now merged into `master`.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the long and the short of all this is that *we cannot just turn a theme on and off with Django settings*, since Rake cannot parse a Django settings file. Therefore, as is done in production environments, we use a JSON file located in the `ENV_ROOT` (the parent dir of your repo dir) to set the theme settings. The JSON file in dev environments is simply called `env.json`; in production, it\'s named slightly differently. If you want to turn a theme on, then you *must* have this file (or Rake won\'t invoke Mako and set up Sass properly), and if you want to disable the theme, then you either *cannot* have this file (or else Rake will invoke Mako and set up Sass to load the theme\'s Sass) or you have to edit out its theme setting. For simplicity, I use `mv env.json{,.bak}` and `mv env.json{.bak,}` to "disable" and "enable" this file (respectively) as needed.\r\n\r\nMy `env.json` looks like this (edited on 6/3 to reflect updates to how we override marketing URLs):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      "PLATFORM_NAME": "Stanford Online",\r\n      "SITE_NAME": "class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "BUGS_EMAIL": "bugs@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "CONTACT_EMAIL": "contact@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL": "techsupport@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "THEME_NAME": "stanford",\r\n      "MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP": {\r\n        "CONTACT": null,\r\n        "FAQ": null,\r\n        "HONOR": null,\r\n        "PRIVACY": null\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `THEME_NAME` setting is the important one, as it\'s the `themes/<theme-name>` directory that Rake looks for when compiling assets (Django will also reference it too). The others are standard overrides that you could just as well specify in your custom `lms/envs/<settings>.py` file. All of the other settings, however, with the exception of `SITE_NAME`, are *new in this PR*.\r\n\r\nMy Django settings file mimics `lms/envs/aws.py` closely, since I wanted to test that my changes to `aws.py` worked. Here\'s what it looks like, in case you want to copy it in for testing this PR (also edited on 6/3 to reflect marketing URL override updates):\r\n\r\n    # lms/envs/dev_stanford.py\r\n    import json\r\n    \r\n    from .dev import *\r\n    \r\n    with open(ENV_ROOT / "env.json") as env_file:\r\n        ENV_TOKENS = json.load(env_file)\r\n    \r\n    PLATFORM_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'PLATFORM_NAME\']\r\n    SITE_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'SITE_NAME\']\r\n    \r\n    #Theme overrides\r\n    THEME_NAME = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'THEME_NAME\', None)\r\n    if not THEME_NAME is None:\r\n        enable_theme(THEME_NAME)\r\n        FAVICON_PATH = \'themes/%s/images/favicon.ico\' % THEME_NAME\r\n    \r\n    TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL\', TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL)\r\n    CONTACT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'CONTACT_EMAIL\', CONTACT_EMAIL)\r\n    BUGS_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'BUGS_EMAIL\', BUGS_EMAIL)\r\n    \r\n    # Marketing link overrides\r\n    for key, value in ENV_TOKENS.get(\'MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP\', {}).items():\r\n        MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP[key] = value\r\n\r\nTherefore, I boot up my LMS with `rake lms[dev_stanford]`, and life is good.\r\n\r\nSettings changes\r\n----------------------\r\nI added a few new settings in this PR that folks who deploy should know about, in case they want to override them in the `*_vars.yml` files (looking at you guys, @jbau, @e0d, and @jarv).

Unfamiliar here...), I think we have to do something like [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-template-tags/). The `main_django.html` template *is blocking*, since that\'s the base template for the wiki.\r\n* Theme some of the CMS (basically, set the appropriate contact information so that folks don\'t come to the Stanford Studio and wind up posting for help, filing bugs, etc. on the standard edX forums/email inboxes). I\'ll do this soon.'

This happens in `lms/templates/main_django.html`, for example, which is the base template used to render the wiki.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, this isn\'t an issue. The problem we saw was happening in https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/nate/fix-mako-templ-encoding/lms/templates/main_django.html#L32, when the `lms/templates/footer.html` template is loaded. That template happens to be a UTF-8 template, because of the curly quote in [this line](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/nate/fix-mako-templ-encoding/lms/templates/footer.html#L41). Anyway, I\'d get an error that looks like this:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2013-06-03 at 5 40 18 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1433806/603024/5e10405a-ccaf-11e2-9011-3949fceac8fd.png)\r\n\r\nGranted, this is with our theming settings enabled, since I\'m trying to theme the `main_django.html` template right now. I narrowed the problem down to the `enable_theme` function in [`lms/envs/common.py`](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/nate/fix-mako-templ-encoding/lms/envs/common.py#L726), which toggles an `MITX_FEATURE` and adds theming paths to `TEMPLATE_DIRS`, `MAKO_TEMPLATES[\'main\']`, and `STATICFILES_DIRS`.\r\n\r\n@jbau and I worked for a long time to try and reproduce this off of `master`, and we couldn\'t get anything reliable. As far as we can tell, it may be some weird path through the Mako cache that\'s causing this, and for some reason adding the theme template paths to the Mako lookup paths triggers it. Regardless, this patch fixes the problem for us.\r\n\r\nAnother weird thing to note is that this problem *still* occurs even if the `{% include "footer.html" %}` is wrapped in a conditional that doesn\'t trigger, like:\r\n\r\n    {% if MITX_FEATURES.USE_CUSTOM_THEME %}\r\n        {% include "theme-footer.html" %}\r\n    {% else %}\r\n        {% include "footer.html" %}\r\n    {% endif %}\r\n\r\nRemoving the `{% include "footer.html" %}` line solves the problem though. This is probably because Django just renders the `include` block anyway (?).'

40,'rocha',"Feature/brian/regrade celery 2\n### Implements the ability to rescore problems in a background task.\r\n\r\n#### Instructor Dashboard:\r\n\r\nProvides a new section on the grading tab of the instructor dashboard, where staff can specify a problem URL and either rescore all students who have submitted an answer to the problem, or reset attempts to zero for all students who have viewed the problem. A third button permits staff to see a history of all background tasks that have been submitted for the course and problem, rendered as a table at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nTwo new buttons are added to the per-student section of the grading tab. One permits a background task to be started to rescore a specific student's response to a particular problem. The second is to see a history of all background tasks that have been submitted for the course for that particular student and problem.\r\n\r\nWhile on the page, a table appears with the status of any background tasks for the current course that are still running. The tasks that are still unfinished have their status updated every five seconds.\r\n\r\n#### Task submission:\r\n\r\nA CourseTaskLog database table is maintained to keep long-term track of what background tasks have been run. It also is used to identify which tasks are currently running. When a new task is requested, a new entry is created in the table, and is updated with the task_id once submitted to celery. The table is then updated when queries for task status are made, if a task is discovered to be revoked. \r\n\r\nWhen tasks are submitted, information needed from the original web request that is needed for tracking and xqueue configuration are pulled out and passed to the queue, so no request needs to be serialized.\r\n\r\n#### Running tasks:\r\n\r\nA generic task framework to traverse StudentModule objects is implemented, with rescoring and resetting (and deleting) implemented as visitor algorithms. Each individual StudentModule update should be wrapped in its own transaction.  When a task finishes, either with a status of failure (when an exception is encountered) or success, the CourseTaskLog database table is updated.\r\n\r\n#### Rescoring:\r\n\r\nRescoring is implemented at the CapaModule and LoncapaProblem levels. It is mostly the same as checking a problem, except that the student's answer is taken from their persisted state rather than a posted request. Also, there is no rendering of html necessary.\r\n\r\nProblems that support file submissions, like Code Response problems, do not necessarily store the student's answer in the StudentModule persisted state. And since there is currently no good way to tell if a code response was originally submitted as text or as a file, rescoring of these kinds of problems is not supported. This is somewhat convenient, because then all rescoring can be done by the background task synchronously. It doesn't have to queue up the rescoring requests, and wait around for an answer.\r\n\r\n#### Errors:\r\n\r\nWhen staff makes a request, it may result in an immediate error. This shows up as a message rather than a failed task on the table of running tasks.\r\n\r\nThe following are errors:\r\n\r\n* The requested problem URL is not recognized as a real module\r\n* The requested problem URL does not point to a module that supports rescoring (e.g. a video, not a problem)\r\n* The requested problem URL does not point to a problem that supports rescoring (e.g. contains a CodeResponse)\r\n\r\nIf the request does not result in an error, it should show up in the table of running tasks. The last column indicates progress, including the number of attempts, number completed, and the total number of students' responses considered.\r\n\r\nThe following condition results in a particular student's response not being rescored.  It is counted in the number of students' responses that were attempted, but not in the number that were completed:\r\n\r\n* The response was ill-formed in the first place. (E.g. a string when a number is required.)\r\n"

This is a companion to @caesar2164\'s changes in #28 in that both are needed for Stanford\'s 6/11/13 launch. (We\'re in the process of putting together one branch combining both PRs so that you can review/pull it all at once, if you so choose.)\r\n\r\nAs we talked about in the RFC PR in the pre-clean repo, this PR is not a work of art. There are a number of ugly conditionals and hacks that are both Stanford- and edX-specific. However, the idea is that a compromise for now will get us living on `master` and better able to turn this into a full-blown theming layer in the near future. I have tried to pull things out into the settings where possible, but there are a few places (e.g., the `lms/templates/emails/`) where some Stanford-specific hacking was needed to get the desired language in place.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------\r\nFirst, you\'ll need to grab our theme files, located in a public repo at https://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme. We\'ve established a convention that theme files will live outside of the main edx-platform repository, in the `edx_base/themes/<theme-name>` (or `mitx_all/themes/<theme-name>`) directory. To grab the Stanford theme, assuming you\'re inside your repository dir (`edx-platform/`), run:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ..\r\n    $ mkdir themes\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme.git themes/stanford\r\n\r\nProbably the most obnoxious part of themes is that *both* Django and Rake need to know:\r\n\r\n1. whether or not a theme is enabled\r\n2. what the theme\'s name is (since that tells them where to look for templates, static files, etc.)\r\n\r\nDjango needs to know for obvious reasons (adjusting settings like `STATICFILES_DIRS`, `MAKO_TEMPLATES`, etc. and for rendering templates appropriately), and Rake needs to know because it controls static asset compilation. If a theme is enabled, we need to conditionally import the theme\'s Sass overrides into the main LMS Sass files (`lms/static/sass/{application,course}.scss`), and we need to set the Sass compiler\'s load and watch paths appropriately so that the theme\'s Sass files are included in compilation. Unfortunately, [Sass does not support conditional imports](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import), so we instead turn the main LMS Sass files into Mako templates, and use Mako to control the conditional theme import. This Mako invocation is something that must also be done by the Rakefile, since it must be done before the Sass compiler runs. ~~Right now, this is one nasty hack in `assets.rake`, but #5 does this in a much better fashion.~~ (#5 is now merged into `master`.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the long and the short of all this is that *we cannot just turn a theme on and off with Django settings*, since Rake cannot parse a Django settings file. Therefore, as is done in production environments, we use a JSON file located in the `ENV_ROOT` (the parent dir of your repo dir) to set the theme settings. The JSON file in dev environments is simply called `env.json`; in production, it\'s named slightly differently. If you want to turn a theme on, then you *must* have this file (or Rake won\'t invoke Mako and set up Sass properly), and if you want to disable the theme, then you either *cannot* have this file (or else Rake will invoke Mako and set up Sass to load the theme\'s Sass) or you have to edit out its theme setting. For simplicity, I use `mv env.json{,.bak}` and `mv env.json{.bak,}` to "disable" and "enable" this file (respectively) as needed.\r\n\r\nMy `env.json` looks like this (edited on 6/3 to reflect updates to how we override marketing URLs):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      "PLATFORM_NAME": "Stanford Online",\r\n      "SITE_NAME": "class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "BUGS_EMAIL": "bugs@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "CONTACT_EMAIL": "contact@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL": "techsupport@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "THEME_NAME": "stanford",\r\n      "MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP": {\r\n        "CONTACT": null,\r\n        "FAQ": null,\r\n        "HONOR": null,\r\n        "PRIVACY": null\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `THEME_NAME` setting is the important one, as it\'s the `themes/<theme-name>` directory that Rake looks for when compiling assets (Django will also reference it too). The others are standard overrides that you could just as well specify in your custom `lms/envs/<settings>.py` file. All of the other settings, however, with the exception of `SITE_NAME`, are *new in this PR*.\r\n\r\nMy Django settings file mimics `lms/envs/aws.py` closely, since I wanted to test that my changes to `aws.py` worked. Here\'s what it looks like, in case you want to copy it in for testing this PR (also edited on 6/3 to reflect marketing URL override updates):\r\n\r\n    # lms/envs/dev_stanford.py\r\n    import json\r\n    \r\n    from .dev import *\r\n    \r\n    with open(ENV_ROOT / "env.json") as env_file:\r\n        ENV_TOKENS = json.load(env_file)\r\n    \r\n    PLATFORM_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'PLATFORM_NAME\']\r\n    SITE_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'SITE_NAME\']\r\n    \r\n    #Theme overrides\r\n    THEME_NAME = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'THEME_NAME\', None)\r\n    if not THEME_NAME is None:\r\n        enable_theme(THEME_NAME)\r\n        FAVICON_PATH = \'themes/%s/images/favicon.ico\' % THEME_NAME\r\n    \r\n    TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL\', TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL)\r\n    CONTACT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'CONTACT_EMAIL\', CONTACT_EMAIL)\r\n    BUGS_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'BUGS_EMAIL\', BUGS_EMAIL)\r\n    \r\n    # Marketing link overrides\r\n    for key, value in ENV_TOKENS.get(\'MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP\', {}).items():\r\n        MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP[key] = value\r\n\r\nTherefore, I boot up my LMS with `rake lms[dev_stanford]`, and life is good.\r\n\r\nSettings changes\r\n----------------------\r\nI added a few new settings in this PR that folks who deploy should know about, in case they want to override them in the `*_vars.yml` files (looking at you guys, @jbau, @e0d, and @jarv). Here they are:\r\n\r\n* `PLATFORM_NAME` is the display name of the platform (e.g., "edX" or "Stanford Online")\r\n* ~~`UNUSED_MKTG_URLS` allows environments to disable unwanted URLs in the `MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP` (e.g., themes don\'t want a `JOBS` page)~~ (removed on 6/3)\r\n* `TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL` is what it says (e.g., "technical@edx.org"). Likewise, we also have:\r\n* `BUGS_EMAIL` (e.g., "bugs@edx.org")\r\n* `CONTACT_EMAIL` (e.g., "info@edx.org")\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a `FAVICON_PATH` setting, but that\'ll be automatically overridden [when a theme is turned on](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/nate/template-theming/lms/envs/aws.py#L126).\r\n\r\nThe appropriate defaults for all of these settings should be set in `lms/envs/common.py`, and I added overriding code to `lms/envs/aws.py`.

10,'',"Jonahstanley/add more tests\nSuggested Reviewers: @wedaly @jzoldak\r\n\r\nIn this commit, I have done the following\r\n\r\n1.    Refactored the problems.py into problems.py and problems_setup.py\r\n    The purpose of this being that problems.py was a very large file. Now only the steps are in problems.py whereas the information needed to create problems are in problems_setup. This way, it is much easier to see what is needed in adding new problems to the test suite.\r\n\r\n2.    Added in ability to have metadata\r\n    Before, it was not possible to have add problems in the test with metadata specified. Now, there are two main ways to add metadata. Either the problem itself in the problem dictionary can have a metadata key corresponding to a dictionary of metaday keys and values and/or the step can somehow specify the metadata. add_problem_to_course now takes in an optional third argument of metadata which is a dictionary of metadata keys and values.\r\n\r\n3.    Added in testing for showing and hiding answers as well as problems with limited attempts\r\n    Now that we can have metadata, these tests could be added.\r\n    -- For showing and hiding answers, I check that I can click on a show answer button, the answer appears, there is now a hide answer button and when that is clicked, the answer disappears\r\n    -- For limited attempts, I check that if there is 1 attempt, the final check button is there and when the answer is sent (if it is correct or incorrect) there is no option to reset the problem. If there is more than 1 attempt allowed, I check that the user is properly updated on how many chances they have left and once they are on the final guess, the button changes to final check and after that point there is no reset button\r\n\r\nBoth of these tests are slower due to needed to check for buttons that do not appear.\r\n\r\n4.    Sped up some tests\r\n    There were a few tests on lms that were running a bit slow: high-level-tabs, partners and checking ids. These were slow due to unnecessary repeated logic in the scenario. These were sped up by using step tables. Since most of these tests were checking to make sure something was on the page, the checks can be done all at once. Before, the entire scenario (adding a course, logging in, reloading the page, getting the page data) was repeated for each check.\r\n\r\n5.    Quick changes to the cms test suites (there were steps with the same name that weren't used)\r\n\r\n6.    Added my name to the author file\r\n\r\nHopefully, all of these tests will run nicely on the other machines. Also, hopefully the new scenarios and files are easy enough to read.\r\n"

Once this PR is ready, it is intended to be merged so that it can be used as a common basis for further work on the feature. **It is not intended for use on production instances anytime soon**, so is disabled by default using a feature flag. Backwards-incompatible/breaking changes may be introduced in the near future.\r\n\r\n**Discussion**: Architecture discussed extensively on [the wiki](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SOL/Content+Libraries) and in meetings, then the revised proposal was presented to the [Arch Council](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/AC/Architecture+Council) on Oct. 21 and given thumbs up. [Some open questions remain](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SOL/10-22-2014+Architect+Council+Review+of+Content+Libraries).\r\n\r\n**Partner information**: 3rd party-hosted open edX instance, for an edX solutions client.\r\n\r\n**Merge deadline**: TBD\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**: Requires edx/opaque-keys#46, which is already merged.\r\n\r\n**Status**: Demonstrates the very basic features of libraries.\r\n\r\n**Future**: The following will *not* be part of this PR:\r\n* UI/UX improvements, including pagination ([code for this is ready](https://github.com/open-craft/edx-platform/pull/9), PR coming after this one merged)\r\n* Course-specific overrides (implementing this requires careful thought and code review so I\'d like to do it separately in an upcoming pull request). __Note__ that this means that at present, if you import content from a library into a course, then edit the imported blocks from the course view in studio, any such changes will be lost when synchronizing/updating with the latest content blocks from the library. ([code for this is ready](https://github.com/open-craft/edx-platform/pull/6), PR coming after this one merged)\r\n* filtering/tagging\r\n* Support of libraries from non-split courses\r\n* Performance tests (can we have 1,000 problems in the library? 10,000?) - very much depends on how course overrides are implemented, so this is deferred for now\r\n* Permissions - currently uses the same permissions system as courses. ([code for this is ready](https://github.com/open-craft/edx-platform/pull/8), PR coming after this one merged)\r\n\r\n**Testing Instructions**:\r\n\r\n1. Check out this branch and do `paver install_python_prereqs`\r\n2. As \'edxapp\' user, edit `~/cms.env.json` and add `"ENABLE_CONTENT_LIBRARIES": true` to the `FEATURES` object.\r\n3. Edit `~/cms.auth.json`. Go to `MODULESTORE` > `default` > `OPTIONS` > `stores` - it should contain two or three entries. Re-order the entries so that the store with `"NAME": "split",` comes first in the `stores` list. (This makes [split](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Split:-the-versioning,-structure-saving-DAO) the default modulestore for any new courses.)\r\n4. Start `paver devstack studio` and go to `localhost:8001` in your browser.\r\n5. Log in as staff, and create a new library (a new "New library" button should appear at top right of studio home page).\r\n6. Add some content to the library.\r\n7. Go to studio home and go into a course or create a new course.\r\n8. Go to Settings > Advanced Settings and add `"library_content"` to advanced_modules.\r\n9. Go to Content > Outline. Create a new section and subsection, then edit it. Click "Advanced" and add a new "library_content" block.\r\n10. Once the block is added, click "Edit" to edit its settings. Most are explained on the settings editor. For the "Library" setting, you must click "Add", then paste the LibraryLocator of your library. This looks like `library-v1:ProblemX+PR0B`. (It\'s in the URL when you go to the library in studio). Hit Save.\r\n11. Click "Update now with latest components from the library".\r\n12. Optional: Click "View >" to preview all the blocks found in the library.\r\n13. Hit "Publish", then start up the LMS and go to `localhost:8000`. Browse into the course, and you should see that the block is replaced by random blocks from the library. To test the randomization, click the lowest "STAFF DEBUG INFO" link underneath the module, then click "Delete Student State", then refresh the page.'

Having large files there makes our mongo database unwieldy, and causes performance problems. Our solution imposes a hard limit (10MBs) on the front-end as well as backend.

When you attempt to upload a file greater than 10MB, an error message will pop up warning the user that the limit has been exceeded, and giving instructions for how to proceed via an external url. Attempts to circumvent the javascript and directly upload a file larger than the limit will also fail, as the limit is also imposed on the backend.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of the expected behavior (error message):\r\n![screen shot 2014-10-26 at 11 58 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/728509/4784072/2ecbb98a-5d42-11e4-9455-733a11d37378.png)\r\n'

What is your reaction to the idea of moving to hosting the discussion xblock inside edx-platform?  My thinking is we could explicitly label the thing unstable / unsupported for general use, and allow it to make some assumptions about the runtime environment (e.g. "DiscussionService") and share frontend assets at runtime, ending the regime of asset cloning/copying.  From then on the block would continue to be used in Solutions implementations, while at some planned point in the future (Q3? Q4? it\'s not clear yet) we would move it into its own repo in a fully-fledged and officially supported form, with a properly decoupled integration.  I like the idea that over the meantime our teams can have a more incremental collaboration and reuse each other\'s progress, and that we could easily run experimental courses on the edx lms using this block without impacting the older courses."'

Changelog is here: http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/changelog.html#id1\r\n\r\nThe risk of this pull request is that we use Mako for nearly all of our templates. We should have automated tests that cover all of our pages, and if there's a failure with Mako, it would probably result in a render failure that the automated tests would catch (as opposed to a subtly different output). However, our automated tests probably don't cover every permutation of every set of template variables that could be passed to Mako, and there is the small change of subtly different output, so it would be a good idea to have the manual test team take a spin through the CMS and LMS as part of the testing process for this PR, to be sure that nothing is obviously broken."

4100,'',"WIP: Grading Performance Work\nDO NOT MERGE! I'm putting this up for tracking purposes, but the code needs cleanup before it's even ready for review.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nOverall, it represents about a 3x speedup in grade calculation and the loading of the progress page, though it will be less effective on courses that make use of ORA1 or foldit. It also makes about 1/4-1/2 the number of database queries, though more work could be done on this front.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n1. Correctness: Tests pass, but grading tests have never been awesome in their coverage, and we'd probably want to use dev to generate grades for a set of courses the old way and the new, and then diff them, making sure to get coverage of all the problem types.\r\n2. Locking: I'm leveraging FieldDataCache more, and while I think it's safe, we've been bitten by locking problems during the grading process in the past. So we'd definitely want to kick those tires as well."
