Because of the overlays, whenever too many people annotated the image would be hidden behind the yellow colors. Background colors were ditched in favor of the border being the designated item. A bug also has been fixed which didn't allow you to Edit an annotation until another one had been created. \r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** None.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Minimal. Check to make sure that background is removed when image annotations are made. There should be a slight yellow tint during hover and when clicking the thumbnail in the table below. You should now also be able to edit an annotation when page loads instead of having to create an annotation, delete it and edit the original one. \r\n\r\n**Testing: ** Basically follow instructions above.

3769,'jtauber','Improves the way LMS serves /favicon.ico\nIn the original code, the pattern for /favicon.ico is added to the\nlist of URL patterns only when no theme is enabled. This means that,\nwhen /favicon.ico is requested on themed edX, one gets a 404 error.\n\nThis is a pity because there is already a FAVICON_PATH setting which\ncontains the path to the favicon and which already points to the\ntheme\'s one when a theme is enabled.\n\nSo this PR improves the way /favicon.ico is served in several ways:\n\n1. The instruction adding the pattern to the list is moved outside of the\nif not settings.FEATURES["USE_CUSTOM_THEME"] block, so that the pattern\ngets added independently of whether a custom theme is enabled or not.\n\n2. The redirection makes use of settings.STATIC_URL, instead of the\nhard-coded \'/static\' used in the original code.\n\n3. The microsites configuration is taken into account, so that if a\nmicrosite provides its own favicon.ico, it will be that file which will be\nreturned. This is inspired by lms/templates/main.html.\n\n4. The redirection uses the FAVICON_PATH setting. This setting is\ntheme-sensitive, so when a custom theme is enabled, FAVICON_PATH is\nmodified to point to the theme\'s favicon rather than to edX\'s one.\nSo the redirection now benefits from this already implemented behaviour.'

3466,'singingwolfboy','Reconnecting Token Generator for Annotation Tool\n**Background:** As per Christina\'s request I\'ll be turning the Pull Request #2515 into a few smaller PRs. \r\n\r\n**Goal of this PR:** The goal of this PR is to fix two main issues. The first is to use the Firebase Token Generator from the [PyPI version of Firebase](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/firebase-token-generator/1.3.2) and the second is to pass the token as a string rather than create a view (in djangoapp/students) that pops up with the token as a string in the body of the html.\r\n\r\n**CMS Updates:** This one still follows the original first push in that Annotator is not yet working in the CMS (this will change in one of the following chunks). In terms of creating a test environment, the Firebase Token Generator uses a different token standard and the current testing backend does not meet those so please email me to ask for a new secret token and url link to the annotation_storage_url. There are no UI changes.\r\n\r\n**LMS Updates:** Nothing should change in the UI of the LMS, only the way that the token is handled should change. The secret token and url links have been changed so email me for updates. \r\n\r\n**Testing notes:** Once the proper secret token and URL  are placed you should be able to create annotations in the LMS (*not* the CMS). There is a problem if you get a black bar at the top saying "annotation could not be stored" or if you get a 401 error in the console debugger.'

3272,'singingwolfboy','Introducing JSHint.\n**Description**\r\n\r\nI want to propose the following guidelines to all future JavaScript code changes.\r\n\r\n1.) All authors that write and submit JavaScript code (as a pull request, or a separate commit) should run JSHint against the code. The configuration file `.jshintrc` (to be used by all developers) will be placed in the `edx-platfoirm` root. When `jshint` runs, it first checks for `.jshintrc` file in the same directory as the source file, and then travels up the source tree, until it either finds a `.jshintrc` file or (if no `.jshintrc` file is found) uses built-in defaults. Our aim that all developers run JSHint with a standard configuration file, and that there are no hard-errors (see NOTE at the end) reported by JSHint.\r\n\r\n2.) When in doubt about JSHint errors/warnings - use the latest JSHint from [http://www.jshint.com/install/](http://www.jshint.com/install/).\r\n\r\n3.) All new JavaScript files should use the following template:\r\n\r\n    (function (globalVar1, globalVar2, ...) {\r\n        \'use strict\';\r\n        // Your code goes here. In this code you can use globalVar1 etc.\r\n        // and not get an "used before defined" JSHint error. Also, being\r\n        // explicit about what is global is a good way to go!\r\n    }).call(this, window.fullNameGlobalVar1, window.fullNameGlobalVar2, ...);\r\n\r\n4.) All existing JavaScript files that are modified should be updated so that they pass against JSHint using the edx-platform `.jshintrc` file, and rewritten to use the wrapper anonymous function template from above.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I believe that only JSHint warnings should be disregarded of the type "unused variable", when that unused variable is a function parameter that can\'t be removed. For example:\r\n\r\n    (function ($) {\r\n        \'use strict\';\r\n\r\n        var test = [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\'];\r\n\r\n        $.each(test, function (index, value) {\r\n            console.log(value);\r\n        });\r\n    }).call(this, window.jQuery);\r\n\r\nIn this case JSHint will give a warning about `index` not being used. It is safe to disregard these kind of warning.\r\n\r\n**Special thanks** to @jmclaus for providing his original `.jshintrc` file! It was modified a bit.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nOften, JSHint will catch silly errors right in the editor. You will see that you have coded something wrong without having to start up Studio or LMS and checking your changes in the browser. We all know the pain of waiting for the system to start up only to find that you have let a little JavaScript syntax error slip by.\r\n\r\nAlso, for a long time we are without a JavaScript standard and guidelines.

This is because the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference) is loaded by a simple `<script />` tag which causes the browser to halt all execution and wait for the script to load before continuing with fetching other JavaScript files, and rendering the DOM to the page.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nThe first time a page loads that has a YouTube API included, it tries to load the API. After some time, if nothing loads, or an error is returned, then the back-end will be notified that the user doesn't have YouTube available for them. A setting on the server will be stored. On next page load, the loading of the YouTube API will be skipped.\r\n\r\nAfter the page loads, an asynchronous request for the YouTube API will be made. If it is determined that YouTube API is once more available for the student, then the back-end will be notified that the student has access to the YouTube API. The appropriate setting will be updated, and the student will have YouTube API load on subsequent page loads.\r\n\r\n**Technical details**\r\n\r\nThe YouTube API is loaded from 3 points:\r\n\r\n1. The [Studio template](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/cms/templates/base.html) loads the API as a dependency via the Require JS interface.\r\n2. The [LMS template](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/lms/templates/courseware/courseware.html) loads the API as a simple `<script />` tag.\r\n3. The [OVA](http://openvideoannotation.org/) vendor JavaScript module [loads the API](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/common/static/js/vendor/ova/vjs.youtube.js) by programmatically inserting a script tag. Introduced in commit [7e2652b5a8ddaee31594634667293e0fa8967b31](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/commit/7e2652b5a8ddaee31594634667293e0fa8967b31).\r\n\r\n**YouTube blocked imitation**\r\n\r\nTo simulate the effect of an inaccessible YouTube, you can clear your browser's cache, and add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:\r\n\r\n    127.0.0.1       youtube.com\r\n    127.0.0.1       www.youtube.com\r\n    127.0.0.1       173.194.70.93\r\n\r\n*NOTE: Make sure that you don't have a web server running locally (listening and responding on port 80)!*\r\n\r\n**JIRA issue**\r\n\r\n[BLD-531](https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/browse/BLD-531)\r\n\r\n**Original pull request that was closed by mistake**\r\n\r\n[2952](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/2952)\r\n\r\n**Reviewers**\r\n\r\n- @polesye \r\n- @singingwolfboy "

This cookie can be set on the [YouTube HTML5 page](http://www.youtube.com/html5) by requesting the HTML5 player.\r\n\r\nAfter requesting the HTML5 mode, going back to the edX video, and refreshing the page, we see that the HTML5 player loads, but that there is still 1 speed in the speeds dialog. Why is this happening?\r\n\r\nCode flow:\r\n\r\n1. Request HTML5 player for YouTube ID.\r\n2. For some reason Flash player loads (even though we specify `html5 = 1` in the `playerVars` settings array).\r\n3. The YouTube API reports that we have only 1 speed available.\r\n4. The codes thinks that we should switch to Flash player because there is only one speed available. This check was put in place back when the Firefox native HTML5 player did not support multiple speeds. Back then it was decided that if the native API reported only one speed, then we should switch back to Flash mode.\r\n5. After switching to Flash mode, the internal variable `currentPlayerMode` is set to `flash`.\r\n6. THE INTERESTING PART! The second time the API loads up, it is magically in HTML5 player mode! However, since the variable `currentPlayerMode` is set to `flash`, the code doesn't know to update the speed menu, even though the API reports us that we have multiple speeds available.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nIn code, when we query available speeds from the API, if we get back multiple speeds, we disregard the `currentPlayerMode` if it is set to `flash`. We can only be in `html5` mode - Flash doesn't support multiple speeds. In this case, we set `currentPlayerMode` back to `html5`.\r\n\r\n**Reviewers**\r\n\r\n- @polesye "

When the last transcript line is read by the screen reader, and the video ends, nothing happens to inform the user that the video ended.\r\n\r\n<b>Solution</b>\r\nWhen the video ends (either on end time, or at the end), the `title` attribute of the time slider knob is set to `video ended`.

40,'rocha',"Feature/brian/regrade celery 2\n### Implements the ability to rescore problems in a background task.\r\n\r\n#### Instructor Dashboard:\r\n\r\nProvides a new section on the grading tab of the instructor dashboard, where staff can specify a problem URL and either rescore all students who have submitted an answer to the problem, or reset attempts to zero for all students who have viewed the problem. A third button permits staff to see a history of all background tasks that have been submitted for the course and problem, rendered as a table at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nTwo new buttons are added to the per-student section of the grading tab. One permits a background task to be started to rescore a specific student's response to a particular problem. The second is to see a history of all background tasks that have been submitted for the course for that particular student and problem.\r\n\r\nWhile on the page, a table appears with the status of any background tasks for the current course that are still running. The tasks that are still unfinished have their status updated every five seconds.\r\n\r\n#### Task submission:\r\n\r\nA CourseTaskLog database table is maintained to keep long-term track of what background tasks have been run. It also is used to identify which tasks are currently running. When a new task is requested, a new entry is created in the table, and is updated with the task_id once submitted to celery. The table is then updated when queries for task status are made, if a task is discovered to be revoked. \r\n\r\nWhen tasks are submitted, information needed from the original web request that is needed for tracking and xqueue configuration are pulled out and passed to the queue, so no request needs to be serialized.\r\n\r\n#### Running tasks:\r\n\r\nA generic task framework to traverse StudentModule objects is implemented, with rescoring and resetting (and deleting) implemented as visitor algorithms. Each individual StudentModule update should be wrapped in its own transaction.  When a task finishes, either with a status of failure (when an exception is encountered) or success, the CourseTaskLog database table is updated.\r\n\r\n#### Rescoring:\r\n\r\nRescoring is implemented at the CapaModule and LoncapaProblem levels. It is mostly the same as checking a problem, except that the student's answer is taken from their persisted state rather than a posted request. Also, there is no rendering of html necessary.\r\n\r\nProblems that support file submissions, like Code Response problems, do not necessarily store the student's answer in the StudentModule persisted state. And since there is currently no good way to tell if a code response was originally submitted as text or as a file, rescoring of these kinds of problems is not supported. This is somewhat convenient, because then all rescoring can be done by the background task synchronously. It doesn't have to queue up the rescoring requests, and wait around for an answer.\r\n\r\n#### Errors:\r\n\r\nWhen staff makes a request, it may result in an immediate error. This shows up as a message rather than a failed task on the table of running tasks.\r\n\r\nThe following are errors:\r\n\r\n* The requested problem URL is not recognized as a real module\r\n* The requested problem URL does not point to a module that supports rescoring (e.g. a video, not a problem)\r\n* The requested problem URL does not point to a problem that supports rescoring (e.g. contains a CodeResponse)\r\n\r\nIf the request does not result in an error, it should show up in the table of running tasks. The last column indicates progress, including the number of attempts, number completed, and the total number of students' responses considered.\r\n\r\nThe following condition results in a particular student's response not being rescored.  It is counted in the number of students' responses that were attempted, but not in the number that were completed:\r\n\r\n* The response was ill-formed in the first place. (E.g. a string when a number is required.)\r\n"
36,'ormsbee','LMS template theming for Stanford 6/11/13 launch\nFor @cpennington @ormsbee @frrrances @talbs @markchang @sefk @jinpa @caesar2164\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n------------\r\nThis is based on [last week\'s conversation](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform-pre-clean/pull/2135), and it is the branch that I\'d like to be pulled into `master`. This is a companion to @caesar2164\'s changes in #28 in that both are needed for Stanford\'s 6/11/13 launch. (We\'re in the process of putting together one branch combining both PRs so that you can review/pull it all at once, if you so choose.)\r\n\r\nAs we talked about in the RFC PR in the pre-clean repo, this PR is not a work of art. There are a number of ugly conditionals and hacks that are both Stanford- and edX-specific. However, the idea is that a compromise for now will get us living on `master` and better able to turn this into a full-blown theming layer in the near future. I have tried to pull things out into the settings where possible, but there are a few places (e.g., the `lms/templates/emails/`) where some Stanford-specific hacking was needed to get the desired language in place.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n--------------\r\nFirst, you\'ll need to grab our theme files, located in a public repo at https://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme. We\'ve established a convention that theme files will live outside of the main edx-platform repository, in the `edx_base/themes/<theme-name>` (or `mitx_all/themes/<theme-name>`) directory. To grab the Stanford theme, assuming you\'re inside your repository dir (`edx-platform/`), run:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ..\r\n    $ mkdir themes\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/Stanford-Online/edx-theme.git themes/stanford\r\n\r\nProbably the most obnoxious part of themes is that *both* Django and Rake need to know:\r\n\r\n1. whether or not a theme is enabled\r\n2. what the theme\'s name is (since that tells them where to look for templates, static files, etc.)\r\n\r\nDjango needs to know for obvious reasons (adjusting settings like `STATICFILES_DIRS`, `MAKO_TEMPLATES`, etc. and for rendering templates appropriately), and Rake needs to know because it controls static asset compilation. If a theme is enabled, we need to conditionally import the theme\'s Sass overrides into the main LMS Sass files (`lms/static/sass/{application,course}.scss`), and we need to set the Sass compiler\'s load and watch paths appropriately so that the theme\'s Sass files are included in compilation. Unfortunately, [Sass does not support conditional imports](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import), so we instead turn the main LMS Sass files into Mako templates, and use Mako to control the conditional theme import. This Mako invocation is something that must also be done by the Rakefile, since it must be done before the Sass compiler runs. ~~Right now, this is one nasty hack in `assets.rake`, but #5 does this in a much better fashion.~~ (#5 is now merged into `master`.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the long and the short of all this is that *we cannot just turn a theme on and off with Django settings*, since Rake cannot parse a Django settings file. Therefore, as is done in production environments, we use a JSON file located in the `ENV_ROOT` (the parent dir of your repo dir) to set the theme settings. The JSON file in dev environments is simply called `env.json`; in production, it\'s named slightly differently. If you want to turn a theme on, then you *must* have this file (or Rake won\'t invoke Mako and set up Sass properly), and if you want to disable the theme, then you either *cannot* have this file (or else Rake will invoke Mako and set up Sass to load the theme\'s Sass) or you have to edit out its theme setting. For simplicity, I use `mv env.json{,.bak}` and `mv env.json{.bak,}` to "disable" and "enable" this file (respectively) as needed.\r\n\r\nMy `env.json` looks like this (edited on 6/3 to reflect updates to how we override marketing URLs):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      "PLATFORM_NAME": "Stanford Online",\r\n      "SITE_NAME": "class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "BUGS_EMAIL": "bugs@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "CONTACT_EMAIL": "contact@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL": "techsupport@class.stanford.edu",\r\n      "THEME_NAME": "stanford",\r\n      "MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP": {\r\n        "CONTACT": null,\r\n        "FAQ": null,\r\n        "HONOR": null,\r\n        "PRIVACY": null\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `THEME_NAME` setting is the important one, as it\'s the `themes/<theme-name>` directory that Rake looks for when compiling assets (Django will also reference it too). The others are standard overrides that you could just as well specify in your custom `lms/envs/<settings>.py` file. All of the other settings, however, with the exception of `SITE_NAME`, are *new in this PR*.\r\n\r\nMy Django settings file mimics `lms/envs/aws.py` closely, since I wanted to test that my changes to `aws.py` worked. Here\'s what it looks like, in case you want to copy it in for testing this PR (also edited on 6/3 to reflect marketing URL override updates):\r\n\r\n    # lms/envs/dev_stanford.py\r\n    import json\r\n    \r\n    from .dev import *\r\n    \r\n    with open(ENV_ROOT / "env.json") as env_file:\r\n        ENV_TOKENS = json.load(env_file)\r\n    \r\n    PLATFORM_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'PLATFORM_NAME\']\r\n    SITE_NAME = ENV_TOKENS[\'SITE_NAME\']\r\n    \r\n    #Theme overrides\r\n    THEME_NAME = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'THEME_NAME\', None)\r\n    if not THEME_NAME is None:\r\n        enable_theme(THEME_NAME)\r\n        FAVICON_PATH = \'themes/%s/images/favicon.ico\' % THEME_NAME\r\n    \r\n    TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL\', TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL)\r\n    CONTACT_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'CONTACT_EMAIL\', CONTACT_EMAIL)\r\n    BUGS_EMAIL = ENV_TOKENS.get(\'BUGS_EMAIL\', BUGS_EMAIL)\r\n    \r\n    # Marketing link overrides\r\n    for key, value in ENV_TOKENS.get(\'MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP\', {}).items():\r\n        MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP[key] = value\r\n\r\nTherefore, I boot up my LMS with `rake lms[dev_stanford]`, and life is good.\r\n\r\nSettings changes\r\n----------------------\r\nI added a few new settings in this PR that folks who deploy should know about, in case they want to override them in the `*_vars.yml` files (looking at you guys, @jbau, @e0d, and @jarv). Here they are:\r\n\r\n* `PLATFORM_NAME` is the display name of the platform (e.g., "edX" or "Stanford Online")\r\n* ~~`UNUSED_MKTG_URLS` allows environments to disable unwanted URLs in the `MKTG_URL_LINK_MAP` (e.g., themes don\'t want a `JOBS` page)~~ (removed on 6/3)\r\n* `TECH_SUPPORT_EMAIL` is what it says (e.g., "technical@edx.org"). Likewise, we also have:\r\n* `BUGS_EMAIL` (e.g., "bugs@edx.org")\r\n* `CONTACT_EMAIL` (e.g., "info@edx.org")\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a `FAVICON_PATH` setting, but that\'ll be automatically overridden [when a theme is turned on](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/nate/template-theming/lms/envs/aws.py#L126).\r\n\r\nThe appropriate defaults for all of these settings should be set in `lms/envs/common.py`, and I added overriding code to `lms/envs/aws.py`. Please let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n--------\r\nAs mentioned above, this PR does leave something to be desired in terms of a better theming layer. I put comments in the code where I think the hacks are particularly heinous. Hopefully we\'ll have time to revisit this soon.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are still a couple of things I see that we have to do in order to get this ready for 6/11:\r\n\r\n* Theme the Django templates (e.g., `lms/templates/registration/password_reset_{confirm,email}.html`, `lms/templates/main_django.html`). I would appreciate advice on how to do this, as from what I can tell, the `settings` are not made available to these templates\' contexts. And since arbitrary Python in Django templates isn\'t possible by default (I think? Unfamiliar here...), I think we have to do something like [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-template-tags/). The `main_django.html` template *is blocking*, since that\'s the base template for the wiki.\r\n* Theme some of the CMS (basically, set the appropriate contact information so that folks don\'t come to the Stanford Studio and wind up posting for help, filing bugs, etc. on the standard edX forums/email inboxes). I\'ll do this soon.'

5,'cpennington','Preprocess assets as Django management command\nRather than directly invoke command-line Python (and Mako) from the\r\nassets Rakefile, or call an external Python script, use a Django\r\nmanagement command to preprocess all asset template files.\r\n\r\nAn "asset template file" is defined as a static asset file with a\r\nfile extension indicating that it needs to be run through a template\r\nengine prior to Sass/CoffeeScript compilation or packaging with other\r\nassets. The preprocess_assets management command will look through\r\nall of the files listed in the `STATICFILES_DIRS`, preprocessing each\r\nas needed. Preprocessing strips off the special template file\r\nextension, creating a new file in the process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only variable accessible in an asset template file is\r\nthe `THEME_NAME`, defined in the settings.'
