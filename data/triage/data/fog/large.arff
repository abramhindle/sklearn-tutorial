Here\'s a reproduction:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nrequire \'fog\'\r\n\r\nFog.mock!\r\n\r\n[\'AWS\', \'Google\'].each do |provider|\r\n  connection = ::Fog::Storage.new({ provider: provider, google_storage_access_key_id: \'xtz\', google_storage_secret_access_key: \'yyy\', aws_access_key_id: \'blah\', aws_secret_access_key: \'moo\' })\r\n\r\n  directory = connection.directories.create(key: "xyz")\r\n  directory.files.create(body: "this is stuff", key: "moo.txt")\r\n\r\n  p directory.files.get("moo.txt").body\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn 1.23.0 this prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\n"this is stuff"\r\n"this is stuff"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut on 1.24.0 this fails like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n"this is stuff"\r\n/Users/dev/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/gems/fog-1.24.0/lib/fog/google/requests/storage/get_object.rb:67:in `get_object\': object_name is required (ArgumentError)\r\n\tfrom /Users/dev/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/gems/fog-1.24.0/lib/fog/google/models/storage/files.rb:62:in `get\'\r\n\tfrom /Users/dev/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2/gems/fog-1.24.0/lib/fog/google/models/storage/file.rb:31:in `body\'\r\n\tfrom test.rb:11:in `block in <main>\'\r\n\tfrom test.rb:5:in `each\'\r\n\tfrom test.rb:5:in `<main>\'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works fine, but it seems that the `File` object for Google has not received a `key`. Printing out the file object looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <Fog::Storage::Google::File\r\n    key=nil,\r\n    cache_control=nil,\r\n    content_disposition=nil,\r\n    content_encoding=nil,\r\n    content_length=13,\r\n    content_md5=nil,\r\n    content_type=nil,\r\n    etag="938e47592dc66e9082e241733ac79328",\r\n    expires=nil,\r\n    last_modified="Fri, 17 Oct 2014 07:54:03 +0000",\r\n    metadata={},\r\n    owner=nil,\r\n    storage_class=nil\r\n  >\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `key` is nil. This is not the case when running with AWS, and I don\'t think it\'s supposed to be, this is causing the subsequent failure when trying to read the body.'

3181,'nirvdrum','Fixed attribute passing for add_interface\nServer model has an `add_interface` method. This method allows attributes to be passed so you can configure options on the interface. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it doesn\'t pass these options to the create_interface call. This in turn leaves `attributes` empty for `create_vm.rb#create_interface` and subsequently `create_vm.rb#create_nic_backing`.\r\n\r\n When you define a `DistributedVirtualPortgroup` as the network attribute, and `create_nic_backing` doesn\'t have `attributes[:datacenter]`, you will end up with a newly created StandardPortgroup instead of the correct `DistributedVirtualPortgroup` in your Backing info for the interface. \r\n\r\nTo solve this you will need to pass along the `datacenter: \'name-your-dc-here\'` param when you call server.add_interface, along with `type`, and `network`. \r\n\r\nTested in ESX 5.5.

3112,'','The Openstack Service Type for Storage should be an array\nIf an Openstack installation doesn\'t have Swift running, trying to connect to Swift via Fog should throw an error indicating that the service is not available.  This is how all of the other services behave.\r\n\r\nHowever, with Swift (the "Storage" service) the `openstack_service_type` is "object-store".  For all other Openstack services, the `openstack_service_type` is an array.  This is important because when the Openstack connection is attempted and fails, it attempts to assemble an error message by calling:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nservice_type.join \', \'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `String` doesn\'t have a `join` method.  So, this fails.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to simply wrap the `Openstack::Storage openstack_service_type` with an array: `["object-store"]`.\r\n\r\nWe\'re currently using Fog 1.19, but I believe I still see the same code in master.  So, this *should* still be a problem in master.  However, if someone has validated that this is actually not a problem in master anymore, please note it in the comments.  Thanks! '

The issue is in the implementation of the <code>clone()</code> request and the _relative_path_ attribute for the _server_. Specifically, the following assumption in _vsphere/requests/compute/vm_clone.rb_:\r\n```ruby\r\n36     #   * \'template_path\'<~String> - *REQUIRED* The path to the machine you\r\n37     #     want to clone FROM.

Yes, this means that I should log an issue with them, but I'm not sure how you would recommend they change their code, since they have an annoying chicken-and-egg initialization problem -- they also don't know which fog providers I need, but they need to make sure they load after fog does, and Rails is not so good about guaranteeing order of execution during startup.\r\n\r\nIn the old days I'd suggest using `autoload` but it seems that's been deprecated: https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/3036681 (or is it?)\r\n\r\nI hacked my fog gem to remove all other providers and, yep, it shaved 400 msec off the load time -- that's 66% off.

Since you can't rely on uploading a public key, setting the password to a known value is useful.  If it is randomly generated, then projects like vagrant-rackspace would need to capture and persist the password.  It's easier to just let the vagrant user select the password and provide it to fog.\r\n\r\nDespite being a relatively small diff, it did cause me a lot of confusion, as there's a few special things happening with the password (i.e. the `adminPass` and `change_admin_password` methods)."

2748,'',"AWS returns RequestLimitExceeded when using servers.create of >15 instances within a 1-2 second period (with 5+ tags per instance), but instances are created.\nDid some digging, turns out the def save within models/compute/server.rb creates the instance using run_instances() but then also does a loop over the tags list and runs create_tags() for each tag. I had about 7 tags applied using :tags within servers.create, which means that since these are not applied as an aggregate API call (which AWS supports according to the docs), I was sending them approx 15+ RunInstances calls, plus 15+ * 7~ (105~) CreateTags calls, which caused the RequestLimitExceeded to kick in. The thing that made me fishy here, is in almost every scenario, the instances were actually created, and in some scenarios 3-4~ tags would be applied to them.\r\n\r\nObviously in an ideal world, we would have this as an atomic operation (all succeed or all fail), but since it's separate API calls, we can't do that.\r\n\r\nI do think to alleviate this issue though, changing the below logic in models/compute/servers.rb to batch the tags into a single CreateTags call would make sense:\r\n\r\n```\r\n198           if tags = self.tags\r\n199             # expect eventual consistency\r\n200             Fog.wait_for { self.reload rescue nil }\r\n201             for key, value in (self.tags = tags)\r\n202               service.tags.create(\r\n203                 :key          => key,\r\n204                 :resource_id  => self.identity,\r\n205                 :value        => value\r\n206               )\r\n207             end\r\n208           end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will require changes to models/compute/tag*.rb as well as the create_tags method upstream from it I believe to accept batching."

2668,'','Fog throwing HTTP 400 / 500 when adding CNAME DNS record to Rackspace\nSo I have been messing around with the Fog. My goal is to create a DNS CNAME record each time a new application is made by adding it to my Rackspace DNS page as an entry.\r\n\r\nThe basic usecase is that I create an app:\r\n\r\n"rhc app-create test <app-type>"\r\nThe namespace is called ns in this instance.\r\nSo it will create a CNAME record on the broker called "test-ns.example.com". It will then try to register this record with my Rackspace account so that people outside of the broker can find the application and SSH to it.\r\n\r\nSo here is the issue.. I am using the following code to register an application:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n def register_application(app_name,namespace,public_hostname)\r\n      fqdn="#{app_name}-#{namespace}.#{@domain_suffix}"\r\n      #create a CNAME record\r\n      update = {\r\n       :value => public_hostname,\r\n       :name => fqdn,\r\n       :type => "CNAME",\r\n       :ttl\t=> 30\r\n      }\r\n      Rails.logger.info "FQDN=#{fqdn}. #{@rackspace_dns_zoneid}"\r\n      Rails.logger.info "Debug message inserted by Kyle Crumpton."\r\n      zone=rackspace.zones.get(@rackspace_dns_zoneid)\r\n      res = zone.records.create(update)\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe @rackspace_dns_zoneid, FQDN, and update parameters all reflect correctly what they should be.\r\nHere is the error when I try and run this method on the Rails Console:\r\n\r\nirb(main):003:0> d.register_application(\'testapp1\',\'testns1\', \'node1.example.com\')\r\nFog::DNS::Rackspace::BadRequest: [HTTP 400 | ] Validation failed. -\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/excon-0.28.0/lib/excon/middlewares/expects.rb:6:in `response_call\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/excon-0.28.0/lib/excon/middlewares/response_parser.rb:8:in `response_call\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/excon-0.28.0/lib/excon/connection.rb:361:in `response\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/excon-0.28.0/lib/excon/connection.rb:254:in `request\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/core/connection.rb:57:in `request\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/core/deprecated/connection.rb:20:in `request\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/rackspace/service.rb:43:in `request\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/rackspace/dns.rb:115:in `request\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/rackspace/requests/dns/add_records.rb:28:in `add_records\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/rackspace/models/dns/record.rb:62:in `create\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/rackspace/models/dns/record.rb:39:in `save\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/fog-1.18.0/lib/fog/core/collection.rb:52:in `create\'\r\n    from /usr/local/share/gems/gems/openshift-origin-dns-rackspace-1.10.16/lib/openshift/rackspace_plugin.rb:71:in `register_application\'\r\n    from (irb):3\r\n    from /usr/share/gems/gems/railties-3.2.13/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:47:in `start\'\r\n    from /usr/share/gems/gems/railties-3.2.13/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:8:in `start\'\r\n    from /usr/share/gems/gems/railties-3.2.13/lib/rails/commands.rb:41:in `<top (required)>\'\r\n    from script/rails:54:in `require\'\r\n    from script/rails:54:in `<main>\'irb(main):004:0>\r\n\r\nSo my question is.. has anyone ever seen anything like this happening?

2602,'','[Core] Split out a "fog-core" gem separate from "fog" and providers\nCC: @krames @rupakg @tokengeek @geemus \r\n\r\n@krames and I had a meeting with @geemus yesterday where we discussed taking action with respect to #1250, #1253, and #1266.  This issue attempts to capture the relevant points as I begin to step in it. :wink: \r\n\r\nThese are clearly important issues to, at least, the fog development community.  They\'ve been discussed for over year.\r\n\r\nBut they\'ve been discussed for over a year.  Someone has to take action first.  I\'m stepping up to be that <strike>patsy</strike> <strike>sucker</strike> person.\r\n\r\nI believe, as you all seem to as well, that these issues hinder the growth and adoption of fog by other developers.  My personal pain point came when attempting to reuse Fog::OpenStack::Orchestration within Rackspace. Not only was testing proving difficult, but reuse proved to be practically impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion, the beginning of all good things for fog\'s future seem to hinge on separating a "fog-core" gem from "fog".  This would enable providers to create their own separate "fog-\\<provider\\>" gems. "fog" will then require "fog-core" and the provider gems.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this is the first step toward #1253.\r\n\r\nIt is my intent to ensure that these changes remain architectural only and do not result in any API breakages.\r\n\r\nThis split then enables #1266. \r\n\r\n"fog-core"\'s test suite, at this time, appears to be minimal. This, at least, gives it the virtues of being easy to separate from the rest of fog and also easy to port to another testing framework than shindo.\r\n\r\nIndividual providers will then have the option to extract their provider implementation and test suites into a separate gem and repo. Among other things, this will allow the providers to adopt whichever testing framework they choose. Responsibility for implementation and testing of provider behavior will then lie solely with the provider.\r\n\r\nI\'ll have a public repo up [here](https://github.com/elight/fog-core) soon.  At this time, I\'ve extracted the pieces required by lib/fog/core.rb into fog-core and what I believe are the attendant shindo tests.\r\n\r\nNext, I\'ll have a fog-core branch [in my personal fork of fog]((https://github.com/elight/fog) which will be absent the pieces in [fog-core](https://github.com/elight/fog-core).  However, this fog will require fog-core.\r\n\r\nFinally, I\'ll ensure that fog and fog-core are working by separating out "fog-rackspace".  I\'ll attempt to use fog-rackspace with solely fog-core at first. That is, in a few brief months, I\'ve seen at least a couple requests for "let me use just a single provider without loading everything else". Then I\'ll augment my branch of fog to require fog-rackspace, remove the rackspace provider from fog, and test again.  If this works, then this issue can then be closed out.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is a success, I hope to later fulfill other aspects of #1253 in later issues and PRs.\r\n\r\n@geemus: \r\n\r\nPerhaps version should be specified in core and both fog and core should be synchronized on version?  We don\'t have to do it thusly.  But Connection encodes the fog version in the HTTP request header. Connection will reside in fog-core. And we want fog to depend on fog-core and not the reverse.

The VM only has private IP, and so does my master vm. Both machines are in the same subnet.\r\n\r\nMy codes uses `sshable?` after submitting VM's specification in order to wait until the SSH is available for provisioning. However, `sshable?` was always returning false although the VM's ssh server was already running (I could do ssh to the VM from master).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I replaced `sshable?` with custom codes that will wait until port 22 of the VM is accessible. By doing so, my codes are working good now.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether this is a limitation of `sshable?` where the VM should have a public IP, or this is a bug?\r\n\r\nAny comments are very welcome!"

It looks like the `#select` was ignored and fog started deleting everything in the bucket.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that `#select` is mutating & returning the receiver instead of a copy, which is then somehow refreshed back to the unfiltered list on the next call.\r\n\r\nThis violates the implicit ruby array contract. Even more than a contract, in fact; an axiom: for `a.each(&:destroy)` to operate on an array other than `a` violates a fairly basic axiom of ruby. Basic enough that in this case, what should have been a trivial command in `irb` caused data loss.\r\n\r\nI tried writing some tests for `Fog::Collection`, since it doesn't seem to be unit tested. The tests showed that it behaves properly on its own. So did `Fog::Storage::Rackspace::Files` when I stubbed `#all` to return some test data, so I must have been stubbing too much. I stopped there because the codebase was making me emotional.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a fog outsider, I think there are real coupling problems in this codebase, and it makes both testing and understanding infeasible. The specifics of talking to each provider, and the enumerable logic for backing an array with lazily loaded data, should be decoupled.

This is because that call returns the ```object``` (variable) which is _not_ updated with the response from the API call (because the server is still in the PENDING state --> which is an artifact of the non-RESTful way in which the GCE api behaves?).\r\n\r\nSo the the subsequent call to ``sshable?``` (in the wait_for loop) will never succeed, because trying to query whether the server is sshable? needs for its ```public_ip_address``` field to be set, which never gets set in this case, because of the code flow described above.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this would be to subsequently call ```reload``` on the server (till its public IP is populated, presumably when the server transitions out of PENDING), and then wait for the ```sshable?``` call to return true. Alternatively, we could query the operation id for the status of the operation, till the server is ready, and then call ```reload``` on the server.\r\n\r\nNote: IMHO, these are 'workarounds' to the quirkiness of the GCE API, which unlike the other APIs, does not immediately return a full representation of the vm (eg - on AWS, the RunInstances call returns the full representation of the server(s), therefore doesnt suffer from this problem)"

It does so by making this call:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  if get_image(image_name, @project).data[\'code\'] == 200\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas, ```get_image``` returns an ```Excon::Response``` (which doesnt have the ```\'code\'``` key. Instead, the check should be:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  if get_image(image_name, @project).data[:status] == 200\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this, trying to spin up instances using a custom image will always fail (silently), because the image will never be found in the project, and fog will assume the image exists in the "global" pool, and proceed to send out the ```insert_server``` request using the broken image url.\r\n\r\n_The silent failure also points to another interesting "problem" here:_\r\n\r\n1. When creating an instance based off a custom image, fog defaults to using the global image pool to construct the URI for the image (as described above).\r\n2. This request is sent out on the wire, and \r\n   * the immediate response from GCE is always a ```:status=200, @data[\'status\'] = PENDING``` .\r\n   * At this point, the code returns a server object back to the caller (because its 200).\r\n   * On inspecting the "operations" section of the GCE console, I can see that it eventually transitions into an "INVALID_FIELD_VALUE: Invalid value for field \'resource.images\'", because the specified image does not exist in the global pool.\r\n   * So the cloud never actually spun up a server really.\r\n3. Now, as for the users code...\r\n   * If the (server creation) call was made using either a ```create``` and ```save```, then the users calls for ```ready?``` will always return false, and I dont know how else he/she is expected to know something went wrong (without querying for the operation)\r\n   * If this code path was executed via ```bootstrap``` , the call will block for a long time, and then fail due to the timeout (since ```ready?``` never returns true).\r\n\r\nThe former (3.a) case is where I was bitten.\r\n\r\n'

1800,'','[rackspace|storage] add large object container and prefix options\nWhen storing an OpenStack Large Object, the object is split into segments which share the same\r\nprefix and are suffixed such that they will sort in the order they should be concatenated back\r\ntogether. `#put_object` is used to upload each segment, then `#put_object_manifest` is used to store\r\na manifest object with a `X-Object-Manifest` header that contains the prefix used for the segments.\r\n\r\n`#put_object_manifest(container, object)` stores the manifest as `container/object` and uses this\r\nsame name for `X-Object-Manifest`. There is no way to specify a separate segment prefix.\r\n\r\nBeing able to use a name for the manifest object that\'s different from the prefix used by the\r\nsegments would make the manifest file easier to identify within the container. Also, while all\r\nsegments must be in the same container, the manifest file may be in a different container.\r\n\r\nBeing the same as the segments\' prefix also creates a problem when you want to use the `Etag`\r\nreturned by a `#head_object` for the manifest object. This `Etag` is a MD5 hexdigest of the\r\nconcatenated `Etag`s for all the segments for the manifest.\r\n\r\n```rb\r\netags = []\r\nprefix = File.basename(large_file)\r\nFile.open(large_file, \'r\') do |file|\r\n  while data = file.read(chunk_size)\r\n    etags << Digest::MD5.hexdigest(data)\r\n    suffix = etags.size.to_s.rjust(5, \'0\')\r\n    connection.put_object(container, "#{ prefix }-#{ suffix }", data, { \'Etag\' => etags.last })\r\n  end\r\n  connection.put_object_manifest(container, prefix)\r\nend\r\n\r\n# etags => ["82d82ca1dbf1deb04f433fc213a57638", "0b7af2259525d8101f313fa6244ef97b"]\r\nexpected = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(etags.join) # => "7447e423f30e20a83ccb0882b90e1405"\r\n\r\n# I don\'t know why this is returned with quotes, but it is.\r\nactual = connection.head_object(container, prefix).headers[\'Etag\'].gsub(\'"\',\'\')\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would expect `actual` to equal `expected`.\r\nHowever, `actual` here is `f74ae5c6ab8115a9ed993c963dc67531`.\r\n\r\nSince the manifest object\'s path is the same as the prefix for the segments, OpenStack sees the\r\nmanifest object as the first segment. So to compute the correct `expected` value, you must prepend\r\nthe manifest object\'s `Etag`:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\netags.unshift "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" # => Digest::MD5.hexdigest(\'\')\r\nexpected = Digest::MD5.hexdigest(etags.join) # => "f74ae5c6ab8115a9ed993c963dc67531"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pull request gives you the option to create a manifest object with a name that will not match\r\nthe segments\' prefix and avoid this work-around.\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nconnection.put_object_manifest(container, \'large_object\', \'segments_prefix\' => \'large_object-\')\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also create the manifest file in a separate container, in which case it doesn\'t matter if\r\nthe manifest name and the segments\' prefix is the same or not.\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nconnection.put_object_manifest(\'container_a\', \'large_object\', \'segments_container\' => \'container_b\')\r\n```\r\n'

The issue with the VM name is it will only check the top level folder instead of the whole datacenter which means if you use folders for organization the VM will never be found unless at top level. I also moved some functionality to a new function so other functions can take advantage of it without having to duplicate code. Like if I want to just verify that a VM exists and a method can be created to call and verify that a VM was returned as oppose to going through the hash build.\r\n\r\nThe only caveat is the get_virtual_machine will take a while depending on how many VMs are returned because the attribute of the name appears to not be included as part of the view created and accessing that property looks like it makes another call which slows down the entire process.\r\n\r\nraw_list_all_virtual_machines method was created and list_all_virtual_machines calls it so methods like the get_vm_by_name do not have to wait for the hash build from list_all_virtual_machines because the hash build is very slow depending on the VMs returned.

Specifically it was for ascending back up parent directories looking.\r\n\r\nWe could not safely allow that because that changes the possible output for `Fog.credentials` to change depending on the environment.\r\n\r\nOne thing this highlighted is that several providers and a few places in core are using a pattern where we are reading values out of `Fog.credentials` at a low level, inside the connection. Most often the `initialize` methods.\r\n\r\nSo the main reason we could not change how the files were loaded was that the accessing credentials were combined with loading of the credentials and is treated it as a global resource.\r\n\r\nSo you create a new Compute service instance with options but `Fog.credentials` is called as a global but *may* have loaded credentials from wherever they had located a file which *may* have added a setting that was wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you use the service Factory `Compute[:provider]` it loads and passes the options anyway but this wasn't documented.\r\n\r\n* I think we need to deprecate `Fog.credentials` so it starts warning.\r\n* Then affected code is updated to not rely on it.\r\n* Then we remove it in 2.0\r\n\r\nThe use in core code is that of public/private SSH key which I think is different enough from service credentials to be handled in another way."

Based on discussions so far I\'ve got:\r\n\r\n* Standardised service interfaces with canonical tests to check (#1252)\r\n* Reduce burden on @geemus  for Fog releases\r\n* Allow providers to update their services without Wes being (unintentional) blocker\r\n* Cleaner separation between core issues and provider issues\r\n* Reduce dependencies for single provider when using Fog as library (no `libxml` for JSON API)\r\n* Minimal memory usage when using single provider\r\n* Reduce number of files when used on PaaS services like Heroku\r\n* Cleaner way to version APIs\r\n* Maintain community without fragmenting to provider ghettos (https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/473#issuecomment-1903823)\r\n* Still simple for users to pick up and start using\r\n* Reduce "churn" updating hardcoded references to new Regions or Images should not warrant a release of Fog but people should be able to update to use them (So provider point release)\r\n\r\nSo there\'s lots of technical gains we can achieve but we need to make sure we don\'t damage the community.\r\n\r\nNext up is discussing possible ways to do this. Then we can get issues for the smaller parts.\r\n\r\nCan we just break everything into gems? Do we have dependencies in `fog-core` we need to break first?\r\n\r\nIs this Fog 2.0 so we can be backwards incompatible?\r\n\r\nThreads, autoloading... etc.'

Next I need to add support for modifying and deleting RDS subnet groups, but first I wanted to see if you guys could check this over to make sure I'm on the right track.\r\n\r\nI based the implementation largely on RDS security groups. One thing in particular to notice is that I'm representing the subnets in a SubnetGroup model as simply an array of strings (the subnet IDs) rather than as a collection of Subnet objects. I'm wondering if this is an acceptable approach, given that the models would cross service namespace boundaries and the simple fact that IDs are basically all you'd need in order to work with the groups.

However they are both implementations of the same OpenStack API, and there is therefore a lot of code duplication and in some cases fewatures present on one provider that should be common to all three. I propose creating a new `RackspaceCloud` provider and making the classes in it and `HP` extend the existing `OpenStack` module's classes, where necessary.\n\nBecause OpenStack supports extensions, this will also be useful as an example for third-party implementations that extend the basic OpenStack functionality, like [Nicira](http://nicira.com/en/openstack).\n\nI have been working on the [jclouds](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/apis/openstack-nova) OpenStack client code, where this is the standard practice, and the providers each extend a particular API. I think a similar model should work nicely here.\n\nTo start with, I suggest creating the `RackspaceCloud` provider module as a PoC to develop the idea of a child provider based on `OpenStack`. At the same time copying some of the shared fields and requests from the existing `RackspaceV2` classes back to `OpenStack` so that the functionality will be available.

This is useful for new features AWS add that you can use without any fog changes like the new ebs_optimzed flag.  Not having this feature has caused a patch to Opscode Knife to be blocked till a new fog release, http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/KNIFE_EC2-79\n\nSo now you can write code like this:\nconnection = Fog::Compute.new({\n  :provider                 => 'AWS',\n  :aws_access_key_id        => 'XXXXXXXX',\n  :aws_secret_access_key    => 'XXXXXXXXXX',\n  :region                   => 'us-west-1',\n  :version                  => '2012-07-20'\n})\n\nserver = connection.servers.create({:flavor_id => 'm1.large',:ebs_optimized => true})\n\nBut to get this change to work I was required to modify /fog/compute.rb as it turned out some bad code was added that stripped out :version since it was used for Rackspace version switching. I pushed that code inside the case statement for when Rackspace is used as I see no one else uses :versions in the way Rackspace does.\n\nI dont have a Rackspace Cloud Server account right now so I cant test but I am pretty confident on a pure code level it is safe.\n\nAlso during compute testing I found that the test had a deleted Window AMI used and this caused the test to hang for me.  I updated the AMI to the latest but I see a few other failures not related to the code I touched so I left it alone.  Looks like the test code can use some TLC.\n\nAnd lastest, where is my fog t-shirt from my last commits ;)"

This is all fine if you own the ELB in your account, but there is no way to do this lookup for an ELB belonging to another AWS account, even though AWS has no trouble doing so from the web console.\n\nAfter discussing this w/ AWS support, it turns out there\'s a simple trick to do this mapping ourselves. Each AWS region has a single HostedZoneID for ELBs in that region. This mapping is the same for all AWS accounts. Here is the list given to me by AWS support:\n\n```ruby\n  def self.zone_mapping\n    @zone_mapping ||= {\n      "us-east-1" => "Z3DZXE0Q79N41H",\n      "us-west-1" => "Z1M58G0W56PQJA",\n      "us-west-2" => "Z33MTJ483KN6FU",\n      "eu-west-1" => "Z3NF1Z3NOM5OY2",\n      "ap-northeast-1" => "Z2YN17T5R711GT",\n      "ap-southeast-1" => "Z1WI8VXHPB1R38",\n      "sa-east-1" => "Z2ES78Y61JGQKS",\n    }\n  end\n```\n\nI propose we handle this lookup in Fog if the user specifies an AliasTarget and only an ELB DNS name (with no HostedZoneID). Since we can figure out the HostedZoneID automatically for all records matching `*.region-name.elb.amazonaws.com`, I think we should do so, rather than requiring app developers to do this mapping themselves.\n\nFYI, this is not documented in AWS stuff anywhere, though they told me they\'d do so at some point.'

Example:\n\n```xml\n<ListResourceRecordSetsResponse xmlns="https://route53.amazonaws.com/doc/2012-02-29/">\n   <ResourceRecordSets>\n      <ResourceRecordSet>\n         <Name>\\052.mydomain.com.</Name>\n...\n```\n\nIn my mind, this feels like something Fog should make me not have to care about.

The organization I work for discovered this when upgrading to Fog 1.4 broke our application. To verify the brokenness (Elasticache account required), run:\n\n    bundle exec shindo tests/aws/requests/elasticache/cache_cluster_tests.rb\n\nThe [commit in question](commit 4d81b869) adds several `strip` method calls to one particular AWS API parameter, which is *optional* in most cases, with the result that `strip` is called on `nil` in the default case. It seems the author of the commit discovered that Amazon honors leading and trailing whitespace is most (if not all) of its API parameters. Since this did not suit the needs of the author\'s application, they decided to patch several service modules in the Fog library -- but for this API parameter only.\n\nFirst, let me express my strong opinion that this commit was poorly thought out, for the following reasons:\n\n1. There may be a reason why some users would want leading or trailing whitespace in this parameter.\n\n2. It produces code and behavior inconsistent with the rest of the Fog library, and thus *unexpected* behavior. Why trim this parameter and no others? What about other cloud providers -- do they enforce such a restriction?\n\nMy point is, if we collectively decide that Fog is going to trim whitespace from service parameters, then let\'s do so consistently, and for a good reason -- not just in a particular case, because it makes someone\'s application code shorter.\n\nSecondly, this event has raised a code quality "yellow light" within my organization, because a commit that obviously breaks the tests has been in the repo for several months. In a project of this size, where end-to-end testing is so problematic, it\'s probably not realistic to expect that the person who merges the code into the master branch run the tests for the service module(s) in question (though that *would* be ideal). However, I think it *is* reasonable to insist that all authors:\n\n1. RUN THE TESTS WHILE CODING; and\n2. DO **NOT** SUBMIT CODE THAT BREAKS THE TESTS.\n\n@geemus Please let me know whether you agree on both of these points. Would love to have a discussion surrounding continuous integration, even if only in `FOG_MOCK` mode. Several new services seem to be popping up that provide this for open-source projects.\n\n-benton\n\n\n[commit 4d81b869]: https://github.com/fog/fog/commit/4d81b869bc86f84845be9eb5a694f31b13376951'

In order to make proper shindo testing i had to implement mocking for **get_user** and **get_user_policy** request methods.\n\nA bug already [reported] (https://github.com/fog/fog/pull/189) about the formatting of the document policy was [fixed] (https://github.com/restebanez/fog/blob/0bc0bd45860d44394b4e1477c9a6bb8d1c99b382/lib/fog/aws/parsers/iam/get_user_policy.rb#L18-22).\n\nYou can find the requests to models mapping in this [document](https://gist.github.com/2836309). You can disregard the [Agifog](https://github.com/restebanez/agifog) parts. In case you're interested Agifog turns fog into a restful API.\n\nThis is my first time doing fog models so I'd appreciate any feedback to improve this pull request.\n\nThis shindo tests look like this:\n\n    Fog::Compute[:iam] | access_keys (aws, iam)\n      #all (there are no access keys for a new user) + succeeds\n      #create (an access key) + succeeds\n      #all (there are two access keys) + succeeds\n      #get\n        a valid access key id + succeeds\n        an invalid access key + succeeds\n      #destroy (decrease by one the number of access keys) + succeeds\n    \n    Fog::Compute[:iam] | policies (aws, iam)\n      #all (there is no policies) + succeeds\n      #create\n        a valid policy + succeeds\n      #all (there are two policies) + succeeds\n      #get\n        a valid policy + succeeds\n        an invalid policy + succeeds\n      #destroy + succeeds\n    \n    Fog::Compute[:iam] | users (aws, iam)\n      #create + succeeds\n      #all (there is only one user) + succeeds\n      #all (the only user should match) + succeeds\n      #create (a second user) + succeeds\n      #all (there are two users) + succeeds\n      #get (an existing user) + succeeds\n      #get (returns nil if the user doesn't exists) + succeeds\n      #policies (it has no policies) + succeeds\n      #access_keys (it has no keys) + succeeds\n      #destroy (an existing user) + succeeds\n      #destroy (clean up remaining user) + succeeds\n    \n    23 succeeded in 0.975087 seconds\n\nThanks,\n\nRodrigo Estebanez"

I ran the tests with multi_json 1.2.0 and 1.3.2 and didn't seem to have any problems.\r\n\r\nOne change introduced that I'm not wild about is we use to lazy require 'multi_json'.  I now require it optimistically in 'fog/core/json.rb', but this file gets loaded everywhere, so we effectively always load multi_json.  We could relax that, but I liked caching the results of the `:respond_to?` call, since introspecting on every call would incur considerably more overhead than requiring once.

Granted, multi_json put us in a very odd position here.  But, I think the proper thing to do is drop the dependency version back to "~> 1.0" and use `:respond_to?` to choose between the two APIs.  Or, we should go back to the deprecated API and cope with the messages.  Flat out changing the API though is akin to multi_json 2.0 upgrade -- it breaks anything still using a 1.x version.'

But here\'s a running history, and a fix.\r\n\r\n\r\nFog EC2 Server Collection Parsing Error\r\n===\r\n\r\nFirst, I noticed that some of our EC2 server instances were returning with no IDs.\r\nThe following code should always produce an empty array, but for fog >= 1.2, I kept getting entries in the following Array:\r\n\r\n    no_ids = Fog::Compute[:aws].servers.select {|s| s.id == nil}\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, found that the ID-less instances do not actually correspond to running instances. Here I compare the output of the EC2 command-line utility against Fog:\r\n\r\n    ╭─@Diderot.local ~/projects/fog ‹ruby-1.9.3› ‹master›\r\n    ╰─ ec2-describe-instances | grep INSTANCE | wc -l\r\n         115\r\n    ╭─@Diderot.local ~/projects/fog ‹ruby-1.9.3› ‹master›\r\n    ╰─ bundle exec fog\r\n     Welcome to fog interactive!\r\n     :default provides AWS, VirtualBox and Vmfusion\r\n    >> Fog::Compute[:aws].servers.count\r\n    117\r\n\r\nHmmmm, something\'s wrong with the Fog Collection `Compute[:aws].servers`. Here\'s the Fog code that parses the response body from Excon (from `lib/fog/aws/models/compute/servers.rb`):\r\n\r\n    data = connection.describe_instances(filters).body\r\n    load(\r\n      data[\'reservationSet\'].map do |reservation|\r\n        reservation[\'instancesSet\'].map do |instance|\r\n          instance.merge(:groups => reservation[\'groupSet\'])\r\n        end\r\n      end.flatten\r\n    )\r\n\r\nSo, we\'ve got 2 XML structures that wrap our instances: `reservationSet` and `instancesSet`. Each gets a call to `map`, so as long as the outer call returns the correct count, all is well. Let\'s try this code in IRB to confirm that we\'ve located the problem...\r\n\r\n    ╭─@Diderot.local ~/projects/fog ‹ruby-1.9.3› ‹master›\r\n    ╰─ bundle exec ./bin/fog\r\n      Welcome to fog interactive!\r\n      :default provides AWS, VirtualBox and Vmfusion\r\n    >> (Fog::Compute[:aws].describe_instances.body[\'reservationSet\'].map {|r| r[\'instancesSet\']}).flatten.count\r\n    117\r\n\r\nThere\'s the incorrect count. What if we eliminate parsing of the inner XML and just count `reservationSet`?\r\n\r\n    >> Fog::Compute[:aws].describe_instances.body[\'reservationSet\'].flatten.count\r\n    115\r\n\r\nThere\'s our correct number.\r\nAt least one of these `reservationSet`s must have more than one `instancesSet`...\r\n\r\n    >> fat_sets = Fog::Compute[:aws].describe_instances.body[\'reservationSet\'].select {|r| r[\'instancesSet\'].count > 1}\r\n      [...]\r\n    >> fat_sets.count\r\n    2\r\n    >> fat_sets.map {|set| set[\'instancesSet\'].count}\r\n    [2, 2]\r\n    >> fat_sets.first[\'instancesSet\'][0]\r\n    {"blockDeviceMapping"=>[{"deviceName"=>"/dev/sda1", "volumeId"=>"vol-1b8c2672", "status"=>"attached", "attachTime"=>2011-03-24 19:38:20 UTC, "deleteOnTermination"=>true}], "instanceState"=>{"code"=>80, "name"=>"stopped"}, "monitoring"=>{"state"=>false}, "placement"=>{"availabilityZone"=>"us-east-1c", "groupName"=>nil, "tenancy"=>"default"}, "productCodes"=>[], "stateReason"=>{"code"=>0}, "tagSet"=>{}, "instanceId"=>"i-0745236c", "imageId"=>"ami-f11ff098", "privateDnsName"=>nil, "dnsName"=>nil, "reason"=>"User initiated (2011-03-24 19:37:49 GMT)", "keyName"=>"CorpIT_NAS", "amiLaunchIndex"=>0, "instanceType"=>"m1.small", "launchTime"=>2011-03-21 19:58:07 UTC, "platform"=>"windows", "subnetId"=>"subnet-b78544de", "vpcId"=>"vpc-b28544db", "privateIpAddress"=>"10.225.50.8", "architecture"=>"i386", "rootDeviceType"=>"ebs", "clientToken"=>nil}\r\n    >> fat_sets.first[\'instancesSet\'][1]\r\n    {"blockDeviceMapping"=>[], "instanceState"=>{}, "monitoring"=>{}, "placement"=>{}, "productCodes"=>[], "stateReason"=>{}, "tagSet"=>{}}\r\n\r\nThere it is -- an empty item in `instancesSet`. There\'s one in both the `fat_sets`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fix\r\n===\r\n\r\nOK, so our extra instances are being caused by an empty `instancesSet`. \r\nWhat if we just filter those out?\r\n\r\n    >> (Fog::Compute[:aws].describe_instances.body[\'reservationSet\'].map do |r| \r\n    ?>   r[\'instancesSet\'].select {|i| i[\'instanceId\'] != nil}\r\n    >> end).flatten.count\r\n    117\r\n\r\nWorks just fine. The code fix goes into line 59 of the relevant parser,\r\n`lib/fog/aws/parsers/compute/describe_instances.rb`:\r\n\r\n    if @instance[\'instanceId\'] != nil\r\n      @reservation[\'instancesSet\'] << @instance\r\n    end\r\n\r\n(The existing code is just the middle line, without the test for nil identity.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI will try to answer the following questions before submitting a pull request:\r\n\r\n  * Why is this happening in the first place? \r\n    Does the XML response from Amazon have some empty tags? \r\n    Or is there some other bug in the parser that I\'m missing?\r\n  * Under what conditions does this problem manifest?\r\n  * How can I write a test for it?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I  can easily look at the whole response body (pre-parsing) when parsing with SAX?\r\n\r\n- benton\r\n\r\n'

I have never seen it for much smaller files.\r\n\r\nI think I can rule out three frequently reported causes: wrong endpoint (I\'m setting the region explicitly and creating the bucket immediately before use); files too big (this problem is reported only for multi-gigabyte files); wrong bucket name (I\'m creating the bucket and then immediately using the object returned.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the code I\'m using.\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nconnection = Fog::Storage.new(:provider => :aws,\r\n                              :region => \'eu-west-1\',\r\n                              :aws_access_key_id => \'<redacted>\',\r\n                              :aws_secret_access_key => \'<redacted>\')\r\ndirectory = connection.directories.create(:key => \'<redacted>\')\r\n\r\nDir.glob(\'out/*\').each do |file|\r\n  File.open(file) { |f| directory.files.create(:key => File.basename(file), :body => f) }\r\nend\r\n````\r\n\r\nI wonder, looking at that now, whether it\'s possible that the region is not getting propagated correctly to the directory object.

To get around that, I\'m doing this:\r\n\r\n    connection.https_url({\r\n      headers: {},\r\n      method:  \'GET\',\r\n      path:    \'my-bucket.example.com\',\r\n      host:    \'s3.amazonaws.com\'\r\n    }, 0)\r\n\r\nWhich gives me this:\r\n\r\n    https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket.example.com/file.pdf?<query-params>\r\n\r\nThe reason this seems to happen is because of the Regex matching in `Fog::Storage::AWS::GetObjectHttpsUrl#get_object_https_url`. Interestingly enough, there\'s a very similar (but different) Regex in `Fog::Storage::AWS::File#public_url` that would behave correctly, at least as far as this situation is concerned. The regular expressions in question:\r\n\r\n    get_object_https_url: => /^(?:[a-z]|\\d(?!\\d{0,2}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3}$))(?:[a-z0-9]|\\.(?![\\.\\-])|\\-(?![\\.])){1,61}[a-z0-9]$/\r\n    public_url:           => /^(?:[a-z]|\\d(?!\\d{0,2}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3}$))(?:[a-z0-9]|\\-(?![\\.])){1,61}[a-z0-9]$/\r\n\r\nI\'m sure there\'s a reason these regular expressions are different, I just can\'t work out what that reason is. Can someone explain?\r\n\r\n[1]: https://wincent.com/wiki/HTTPS_access_to_Amazon_S3_buckets'

The S3 docs make no explicit guarantee on order, so I didn\'t worry about it, but the differences between mock & real were fixed by reversing the sort order.  This may break in the future if results truly are sorted in a nondeterministic order, in which case we\'d have to compare Sets instead of Arrays.\r\n\r\n* There were some issues delineating between AccessDenied & NotFound, depending on the bucket name used.  If anyone ever creates the bucket "fognonbucket" and doesn\'t tear it down, we\'re going to have a lot of failures.\r\n\r\n* There may be sporadic failures doing the request tests un-mocked.  It seems with versioning in particular it can take S3 several seconds to update the bucket configuration.  I\'m open to suggestions on how to fix this.  Sleeping for 15s seems to be the safest way, but that\'s quite annoying and still not even guaranteed to pass.'

This is done with carrierwave/fog. \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCarrierWave.configure do |config|\r\n  \r\n  # Store the files locally for development\r\n  config.storage = (Rails.env.development? or Rails.env.test?) ? :file : :fog\r\n  config.fog_credentials = {\r\n    :provider               => 'AWS',\r\n    :aws_access_key_id      => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\r\n    :aws_secret_access_key  => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\r\n    :region                 => 'us-east-1'\r\n  }\r\n  config.fog_public     = false\r\n  config.fog_directory  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'\r\n  config.fog_attributes = { 'Cache-Control'=>'max-age=315576000', 'Expires' => 1.week.from_now.httpdate }\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when I set fog_public to false, images are no longer cached, because the signature in the url changes. The signature appears to be generated for every request regardless of time in between. For example, you can hit a page with 50 images all images are downloaded, refresh immediately, still downloaded... This can be verified with chromes inspector, or firebug in firefox. Status code should be 304 Not Modified, but instead is 200 OK.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is: Is caching supported on private urls with s3 using fog, or should I work out other means for serving protected urls, or am I just plain doing it wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

Firstly this patch brings the Fog vmfusion provider in line with the recently released v0.4.0 version of the Fission project by aligning various method names.  During this sync up servers.rb was modified to obtain all VM states and passing them to the raw object instead of doing so when attributes are obtained inside server.rb.  This improves performance a lot since it reduces the need to run vmrun for every VM on the system.  Other changes being made to the provider are so that it returns data and acts more similar to the vsphere provider while still keeping backward compatibility with the original implementation; which was to be more similar to various cloud providers.'

In 1.1.2, when calling `Compute[:aws].servers.create`:\r\n\r\n* `:flavor` wants a `Fog::Compute::AWS::Flavor` object, and will raise an error if it gets a string\r\n* `:flavor_id` wants a `String` (e.g. `'m1.large'`), and will raise an error if it gets an object\r\n* `:image` doesn't exist and gets ignored\r\n* `:image_id` wants a string, and will raise an error if it gets an object\r\n\r\nWhat is the general mechanism that relates `:flavor` to `:flavor_id`, if any? It seems to me that an ideal API would:\r\n\r\n* Raise an error if you call `create` with an attribute that doesn't exist\r\n* Support both `<attribute>` and `<attribute_id>` versions whenever possible\r\n* Either raise a specific error or coerce if you call it with the wrong object type (and I'd argue for coercion in this case, since the API is inherently large, confusing, and unstable due to the problem scope; the smarter it can be, the more discoverable it is)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  I'd be happy to submit a patch to the attribute handler but I'm not sure where to start looking.

636,'','Document SSH key management\nHello everyone,\r\n\r\nsome days ago I was using Fog to bootstrap a virtual machine using Compute::AWS. I was running into some strange timeout errors until I discovered, that these errors are caused by a failed SSH authentication.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a colleague of mine was using [bootstrap](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/master/lib/fog/aws/models/compute/servers.rb#L74) with the same AWS credentials but different SSH keys. So the fog_default public key was already registered to the public key of my colleague and the attempts to log in with my key pair failed.\r\n\r\nIt took me quite a bit of time to grep through the fog source to figure out what I was doing wrong. While reading through the fog code, I found two ways to work around this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Use connection.import_key_pair() to register a custom key and pass in :key_name to bootstrap()\r\n2. Set Fog.credential to a custom name so the SSH public key gets registered using fog_#{custom_name}\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the first workaround my code looked like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nFog.credentials = Fog.credentials.merge({\r\n  :private_key_path => "./keys/my_custom_key",\r\n  :public_key_path => "./keys/my_custom_key.pub"\r\n})\r\n\r\nif connection.key_pairs.get(\'my_custom_key\').nil?\r\n  public_key = IO.read(\'./keys/my_custom_key.pub\')\r\n  connection.import_key_pair(\'my_custom_key\', public_key)\r\nend\r\n\r\nserver = connection.servers.bootstrap(\r\n  :key_name =>  \'my_custom_key\',\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\nUsing the second, the code got much simpler code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nFog.credential = \'my_custom_key\'\r\n\r\nconnection.servers.bootstrap(\r\n  :private_key_path => \'./keys/my_custom_key\',\r\n  :public_key_path => \'./keys/my_custom_key.pub\',\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if this behavior was documented somewhere, so people wouldn\'t run into strange errors caused my wrong key management.'

For example:\r\n   `conn = Fog::Compute[:vsphere];\r\n    conn.servers('path' => '/Datacenters/DC1/vm/Templates')`\r\n   this filter will greatly reduce the number of SOAP API calls by\r\n   limiting the server models in the collection to only those in the\r\n   Templates inventory folder.  Note, this is not recursive yet.\r\n\r\n= Tests =\r\n\r\nTests have been updated.

The root cause of these exceptions are based on the fact\r\n    that some VMware virtual machine attributes: hypervisor name, and\r\n    macaddress, are not available until the cloning process has finished.\r\n    \r\n    These exceptions can be triggered when external events take place within\r\n    the VMware infrastructure such as end-users cloning machines via some\r\n    other VMware management tool.\r\n    \r\n    This patch solves the problem by catching any exceptions that occur\r\n    during attribute lookups for both the hypervisor name and the virtual\r\n    machine macaddress, and setting them to nil.\r\n    \r\n    This patch also removes the host attribute from the hash generated by\r\n    the `Fog::Compute::Vsphere#convert_vm_mob_ref_to_attr_hash` method. The\r\n    hypervisor attribute is added instead, which is an alias to host.\r\n    \r\n    This patch changes the behaviour of the\r\n    `Fog::Compute::Vsphere#convert_vm_mob_ref_to_attr_hash` method by\r\n    catching exceptions for missing attributes, and setting them to nil.\r\n\r\ncommit a65db7f594c6c5fde37d4c393e6438e1d0f71163\r\nAuthor: Kelsey Hightower <kelsey@puppetlabs.com>\r\nDate:   Tue Nov 8 00:47:27 2011 -0500\r\n\r\n    (#10570) Update `Fog::Compute::Vsphere` tests\r\n    \r\n    Update `Fog::Compute::Vsphere` tests to reflect the way the\r\n    `Fog::Compute::Vsphere#convert_vm_mob_ref_to_attr_hash` method currently\r\n    converts a `RbVmomi::VIM::ManagedObject` object to a hash.\r\n    \r\n    Without this patch, tests related to converting an instance of\r\n    `RbVmomi::VIM::ManagedObject` to a hash will raise an exception:\r\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `collect!' for Hash; causing the test to\r\n    fail.\r\n    \r\n    This patch solves the problem by mocking `RbVmomi::VIM::ManagedObject`\r\n    with a new `MockManagedObject` class, which provides a `collect!`\r\n    method, and the `_ref` and `parent` attributes.\r\n    \r\n    This patch renames fake_vm to fake_vm_mob_ref in order to provide a\r\n    more descriptive name for what's actually being tested.\r\n    \r\n    The `Fog::Compute::Vshpere::Mock` class has been updated to require the\r\n    rbvmomi library, which prevents an `NameError` exception from being raised\r\n    due to the `Fog::Compute::Vsphere::Shared::RbVmomi` constant not being\r\n    initialized.\r\n    \r\n    The `Fog::Compute::Vshpere::Mock` class has been updated with a\r\n    `get_folder_path` method, which prevents a `NoMethodError` exception\r\n    from being raised due to the `get_folder_path` method being undefined."

434,'',"Case sensitivity of ETag header causes an issue for VCR\nI've been using fog on a project and wanted to use VCR for stubbing the HTTP stuff.  The latest Excon addresses a few issues and I've addressed a few more in the the current master branch of VCR, but there's one more issue I'm trying to sort out.\r\n\r\nWhen VCR records an HTTP interaction, it normalizes the casing of the HTTP headers.  `Content-Type` becomes `content-type`, as demonstrated [here](http://relishapp.com/myronmarston/vcr/v/1-10-0/dir/cassettes/cassette-format).  This causes a problem when using VCR to stub fog for S3 stuff because Fog looks for the ETag header with exact casing [here](https://github.com/geemus/fog/blob/843cbc37ac49c2636cf0cd03390aa7cfa58bbb9a/lib/fog/storage/models/aws/file.rb#L120).  When VCR plays back the recorded response, it winds up converting 'etag' to 'Etag', and using that in the stubbed response, but that's not the casing fog expects.  A `NoMethodError` results.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would consider this a bug in VCR, but fixing it is anything but simple.  VCR has the header normalization logic due to the nature of how it was developed: it was initially just a tool for recording Net::HTTP requests with FakeWeb, and it was only later expanded to support other HTTP stubbing libraries and other HTTP client libraries.  `Net::HTTP` normalizes headers to lowercase, and as I added support for new libraries, I preserved this behavior--the idea being that a VCR cassette is an abstraction that should be the same regardless of the HTTP library used.\r\n\r\nLong term, I have plans for some changes to the VCR cassette format that would include changing this behavior so that HTTP headers are preserved exactly-as-is--but that's down the road, probably for 2.0.  In the short term, I'm OK putting in a slightly hacky work-around to treat the `ETag` header differently so that on playback it converts `etag` to `ETag` rather than `Etag`.\r\n\r\nI started working working on this today but have been stumped by the fact that Rack itself normalizes `ETag` to `Etag` (in spite of the fact that it is `ETag` in the RFC).  Check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/1086910)--it demonstrates this rack behavior.  I use rack (well, Sinatra, really) in my tests but I can't really even create a proper end-to-end test for this since I can't get the rack server to return `ETag`.  Thinking about this some more--if I put in the short-term fix of converting `etag` to `ETag` on playback, that may break some the use of VCR for some other libraries.  Consider the case where there is a library that is an API wrapper for an HTTP API served up by rack--the header will be returned as `Etag`, and if the client logic is case sensitive (as yours is), it will depend upon casing being `Etag`.\r\n\r\nAll that is to say...I'm not sure what the right short-term fix is.  Would you consider changing Fog's logic to be tolerant of different casing for HTTP headers (or at least for ETag)?  i'd definitely consider this a bug in VCR, not in Fog, but given the fact that it's impossible to return an ETag header with some servers (like Rack) making it case-insensitivity would seem to make the Fog logic more robust anyway.\r\n\r\nLong term, I hope to get VCR to the point where it never touches the casing of HTTP headers since there's simply no way to ensure the response is played back the same when it does so.\r\n"

431,'','[aws|elb] Listener creation syntax is inconsistent\nListeners created at the same time as the ELB need to be passed in using the `ListenerDescriptions` syntax, whereas when creating them on an existing ELB you create them using the Listener attributes.

Fog users could implement a subscriber pattern to access info about fog reqests (duration, parameters, etc). Subscribers could log request info to a file, put it an audit system, etc.\r\n\r\nBy default, nothing would subscribe to the notifications, so default behavior would not change. \r\n\r\nAs a proof-of-concept, I've hacked up a way to log and instrument fog requests in this gist: https://gist.github.com/920101\r\n\r\nThe proof-of-concept works by monkey-patching private 'request' methods.\r\n\r\nHere's how we can bake this functionality into Fog:\r\n\r\n* implement a Fog::Instrumentation::Notifier class that can send notifications to Subscribers.\r\n* wrap every Fog::provider::service::Real#request method with a call to the notifier (perhaps DRY up the requests too)\r\n* implement a Fog::Instrumentation::Subscriber module to handle notifications. By default, it does nothing with notifications.\r\n\r\nUsers who want to log/instrument requests can include Fog::Instrumentation::Subscriber in their class to access notifications.\r\n\r\nThis is closely modeled on the ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber (https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/log_subscriber.rb), but it does not depend on it.\r\n\r\nIt might be a few weeks before I can get to this.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAaron\r\n"

The urls I get are in the form of "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/{bucket_name}/{object}" with the signature etc attached. If I change the url to the virtual hosted-style "https://{bucket_name}.s3.amazonaws.com/{object}" the signature works fine.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\ncroaker'

Either way you should have to run `bundle install`.\nSo I'd advocate that the fog.gemspec list no dependencies other than bundler, and user and dev instructions emphasize that `gem install fog` is considered a distribution channel for a minimal subset (the production set) of files in the git repository.\nWether you use `gem install fog` or `git clone ...` you have to run `bundle install` to install the library dependencies, according to what is already on your system.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n- `gem install fog` on a test/production machine means you don't mangle/touch the installed gems, and get just what are needed.\n- `gem install fog` is much faster with no external dependencies e.g. \n    \n$ time gem install fog-131.0.0.3.gem --no-ri --no-rdoc\n    Successfully installed fog-131.0.0.3\n    1 gem installed\n    real\t0m0.619s\n    user\t0m0.450s\n    sys\t0m0.170s\n- removes ambiguity about how to install Fog (`bundle install`)\n- `gem install fog` provides a succinct way to grab the released runtime files of fog and no other.\n- Bundler should make developing less painful\n- Bundler should make installation more robust\n- there are not two ways of installing Fog's dependencies.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n- Very unconventional (currently) interpretation of `gem install fog`\n- Since `gem install -y` became the default people now expect `gem install fog` to install something else too, and Fog just won't.\n- It is not what all the other kids are doing.\n- Additional instructions needed until the idea sinks in.\n- Complaints, complaints, complaints\n\nThoughts?"

68,'','aws server ssh/bootstrap frequently hangs when using micro instances\nCurrent implementation has a hacky 10 second sleep which seemed to work.  For some reason if you try to connect prior to some amount of delay net ssh will just hang.  Should instead try earlier, but with a timeout/retry loop until a connection can be established.  That way it can work faster in some cases and in other cases it will at least not fail (mostly the micro case where it seems 10 seconds is not long enough).'

The `auth_token` is indeed required when interacting with the storage, yet I often just need to generate signed URL to dowload private files, but these do require the `management_url` which is received along with the `auth_token` (to extract the scheme, host and port).\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it would be safe to provide these values or the `management_url` directly?

3190,'','Homogenize error handling\nError handling differs a lot between providers in Fog. This is especially annoying when you develop with Fog and have to handle different providers, from the client side, it makes us impossible to rescue exceptions without having to look at each case. Part of what makes Fog a great library is that **centralized** \'API\' for all cloud resources. When everything works well, usually values returned are ```Excon``` responses and one can more or less trust that (I haven\'t tested all corner cases).\r\n\r\nI propose we take seriously error handling and homogenize error handling as much as possible. This requires Fog to provide an interface ```Fog::Errors``` with a few typical errors ```NotFound```, ```Unauthorized```, and make all providers return errors of the type ```Fog::Errors::ProviderName::ParticularError```, i.e: ```Fog::Errors::Openstack::Compute::NotEnoughResources```. Common errors should be raised through ```Fog::Errors``` should provide something already like I mentioned. (that\'s already in fog-core)\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n* Opennebula\r\n  * Fog::Errors::Error\r\n  * Fog::Compute::OpenNebula\r\n* Xen server\r\n  * Fog::Error\r\n  * Fog::XenServer\r\n* Linode\r\n  * Fog::Errors::Error , mostly\r\n  * string (```raise "whatever error"```)\r\n  * Exception\r\n* HP\r\n  * Fog::Errors::Error\r\n  * Fog::HP::(LB/DNS/BlockStorage/Network/HPV2)\r\n* Cloudstack\r\n  * Fog::Compute::Cloudstack\r\n* Google compute engine\r\n  * Raises strings...\r\n* Rackspace\r\n  * Fog::Rackspace\r\n  * Fog::Compute::Rackspace\r\n* Openstack\r\n  * Fog::(Compute | Network)::Openstack\r\n\r\nand the list could go on and on. I think the only provider that is doing consistent error handling generalized for Fog is DigitalOcean and almost Linode. Openstack and AWS handle errors well but if you are developing for both platforms you cannot generally rescue errors for both. There are some providers like Docker (I\'m working on fixing it, that\'s how I found this) that don\'t even pass errors up the stack.\r\n  \r\nWould this be a welcome change? I\'m willing to work on this to some extent, that is, rescuing errors in this fashion where they are already rescued, I cannot take a look at all APIs to see which ones are actually hiding errors.'

Specifically the [`.save` method](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/master/lib/fog/local/models/storage/file.rb#L99) creates parent directories (**ab/cd**/abcd-efgh-ijkl) only if they don't exist before the file is saved.

I stopped because testing with Shindo syntax was too slow.\r\n\r\nAnyway before we run off and create 40 provider based gems that **enforce** lock in due to incompatible interfaces we should probably go back to the original benefit of `fog` as abstracting half a dozen cloud services.\r\n\r\n/cc @geemus but all are invited to comment."

2682,'',"[OpenStack] Create an OpenStack provider that can be easily reused by other OpenStack-based providers\nIf you're a Fog developer working on a Fog provider for an OpenStack cloud, you're either going to:\r\n\r\n* Reinvent the wheel\r\n* Copy-paste much of the Fog OpenStack implementation\r\n\r\nBoth of these solutions are undesirable.\r\n\r\nInstead, Fog's OpenStack provider should be easily reusable within other Fog providers. Currently, this does not seem to be possible as the code within Fog OpenStack seems to be tightly coupled.  For instance, the <code>initialize</code> method in <code>Fog::OpenStack::Compute</code> sets multiple instance variables, an acceptable behavior in an initializer, but also authenticates against that cloud's Keystone auth and eagerly creates a connection to the service's endpoint.\r\n\r\nAn ideal Fog OpenStack provider would loosely couple its behaviors. Setting instance variables should be isolated from authentication and creating the service connection.\r\n\r\nDecoupling these behaviors in the existing Fog OpenStack provider would result in an API-breaking change. This is undesirable.\r\n\r\nInstead, we propose a ground up rewrite of the Fog OpenStack provider, designed from the ground up to be resuable by other Fog providers.  This will allow us, the OpenStack Fog developers, to better leverage one another's work.  \r\n\r\nA rewrite, instead of a refactoring, somewhat eases the migration path for current Fog OpenStack users. It seems better to create a whole new Fog API for OpenStack, and allow developers to transition to it, than to piecemeal break the existing API over several releases.\r\n\r\nWe (Rackspace) and HP have only a few days ago gotten together behind this effort.  Out of a desire to be good Ruby citizens, and in the interest of transparency, I am opening this issue as a forum to include other contributors to the current Fog OpenStack provider in the discussion.\r\n\r\n![Peace and long life](http://www.todayifoundout.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Spock_vulcan-salute.png)"

Here is a sample response from AWS API (obtained via EC2 command line tools):\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/BrindleFly/c2fc52847d5773d3267e\r\n\r\nNote the use of <item> element for three purposes: 1) to denote separate reservation items, 2) to denote tag items for a reservation, and 3) for offering types with a specific reservation.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce you need to have an account tagging Amazon reservations and just do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncompute.describe_reserved_instances.body["reservedInstancesSet"].map {|res|\r\n  puts res.inspect\r\n  puts "-------------"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou get the following for output (note the separation of the items):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{"reservedInstancesId"=>"xxxxxxx", "instanceType"=>"t1.micro", "availabilityZone"=>"us-east-1b", "start"=>2013-08-06 18:57:04 UTC, "duration"=>31536000, "fixedPrice"=>62.0, "usagePrice"=>0.0, "instanceCount"=>1, "productDescription"=>"Windows (Amazon VPC)", "state"=>"active"}\r\n-------------\r\n{"offeringType"=>"Heavy Utilization", "amount"=>0.006}\r\n-------------\r\n{}\r\n-------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty serious issue that could impact all AWS API requests.\r\n'

Also this field can be refactored to accept `Fog::Storage::Google::File` object.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention . :sparkling_heart:'

The OpenStack API also supports passing in snapshot_id instead of volume_id.  When this is done, the API will first create a volume from the snapshot and then map the new volume as the boot device.  This means that create_server is supporting boot from volume but not boot from snapshot.\r\n\r\nThere is also a specific boot_from_snapshot request in the code currently, but it's not fully functional (it's missing basic parameters like nics) and it's completely redundant since 100% of the functionality can be done in create_server just by handling the snapshot_id option.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, the logic in create_server should be:\r\n\r\nif snapshot_id and not volume_id then pass snapshot_id, else pass volume_id\r\n\r\nThis will align with the OpenStack API and allow the boot_from_snapshot request to be deleted.\r\n\r\nAPI reference:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1029211"

There are minor issues with this, such as attribute values always being String regardless of declared type in the schema, and less-minor issues with variable-length sequences, manifesting as parsed responses containing `:Key => Hash` or `:Key => [Hash, Hash]` depending on the sequence length. cf. #2134, #2155, #2166. There will be many more such occurrences.\r\n\r\nWhether `Fog::ToHashDocument` is behaving as intended or not, it\'s used by other providers so it\'s probably unwise to consider whether it should be \'fixed\'.\r\n\r\nIt seems undesirable to continue with piecemeal fixes.

The issue with the VM name is it will only check the top level folder instead of the whole datacenter which means if you use folders for organization the VM will never be found unless at top level. I also moved some functionality to a new function so other functions can take advantage of it without having to duplicate code. Like if I want to just verify that a VM exists and a method can be created to call and verify that a VM was returned as oppose to going through the hash build.\r\n\r\nThe only caveat is the get_virtual_machine will take a while depending on how many VMs are returned because the attribute of the name appears to not be included as part of the view created and accessing that property looks like it makes another call which slows down the entire process.\r\n\r\nraw_list_all_virtual_machines method was created and list_all_virtual_machines calls it so methods like the get_vm_by_name do not have to wait for the hash build from list_all_virtual_machines because the hash build is very slow depending on the VMs returned.

1418,'','"Connection" should be fully wrapped with mocks\nWhilst working on #1392 and general other changes I got the feeling that we are missing a layer or two of abstraction.\r\n\r\nWe have `Fog::Connection` which is a wrapper to Excon. However we get back an `Excon::Response` object which is technically an implementation detail (which HTTP library we are using).\r\n\r\nI think we should be returning a fog specific response. This would also allow us to move the response body parsing to this response object as well.\r\n\r\nIf you look within a `Fog::Service` however, it\'s collections have `requests` and mocked requests. Where this is standing out is for the local virtualisation systems like VirtualBox and Vsphere.\r\n\r\nThe connection within those services is not a HTTP connection to a remote service. Often a \'connection\' through a native Ruby library to the hypervisor.\r\n\r\nThe other abstraction problem is fog\'s mocking is implemented at the Service level. So the factory will give you one of two different classes `Real` or `Mock`. So we are duplicating code or relying on `Shared` modules or worse having two different implementations.\r\n\r\nSo rather than just isolating the live connection to an API we actually have two blocks of code that rely on a HTTP interface.\r\n\r\nSo we are leaking Excon out and we are setting ourselves up so that the request/response model through it\'s interface is the definitive way.\r\n\r\nMy idea for improving this so far:\r\n\r\n* Create errors and a response object as the response for a "request"\r\n* Providers update request to return response object\r\n* Response object returns parsed data not "body" for parsing\r\n* Abstract response frees providers to create their own Connection subclasses, different input standard output (even if still provider specific data).\r\n* Providers raise suitable general errors for any HTTP or code/socket problems with messages\r\n* Move mocking from the Service level down to the Connection level\r\n\r\nNot exactly trivial changes.

Then the openstack implementation can check if vendor is HP or RACKSPACE and do slightly different things (ie metadata is different).\n This would provide a more consistent implementation of openstack instead of the separate rackspace and hp implementations although they could still co-exist with the openstack implementation that supported multiple vendors. \n\n Similarly the AWS implementation need to be enhanced to support eucalyptus and CloudStack as vendors in addition to Amazon. \n\n Anyway I hope this provokes discussion because as the cloud matures certain APIs will become dominant  (I reckon AWS, OpenStack, Azure and Google Compute Engine but who knows).
