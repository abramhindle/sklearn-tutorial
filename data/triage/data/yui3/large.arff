In an effort to consolidate the inheritance of configurations from groups from the master settings to minimize the amount of settings to define per group, we are proposing to have a new configuration option called `baseBase`.\r\n\r\n`baseBase` works similar to `comboBase`, which has to be completed with the `root` value to form the path to a module. If `baseBase` is specified at the top level, along with `comboBase`, and `root` is defined at the top level and per group, then it will be simpler to infer the `base` value per group based on the global `baseBase`.\r\n\r\nThe ideal configuration will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYUI({\r\n      baseBase: 'http://mycdn.com/path/to/',\r\n      comboBase: 'http://mycdn.com/path/to/combo?',\r\n      root: 'yui-3.1.5.0/',\r\n      groups: {\r\n           foo: {\r\n               root: 'bar/'\r\n           },\r\n           bar: {\r\n                root: 'foo/'\r\n           }\r\n      }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, whether we use use combine or not, the `base` does not have to be defined, because it can be computed based on `baseBase` and the corresponding `root` value.\r\n\r\nFew more thoughts:\r\n\r\n* `base` is king. If it is set, it will not be combined, so this change is BC.\r\n* `baseBase` CANNOT be infer from parsing the seed url, it always have to be defined manually (BC too).\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* [ ] should `combine` be inherited/computed as well?"

You'll find the overflow won't scroll by touch. However, uncomment the restoreTo314() method call and the prevent default action of 3.15 is removed. The overflow now correctly scrolls (you'll need an ipad or iphone to test with).\r\n\r\nPlease note: Something about codepen running with the output panel at bottom of screen (full width) messes with the test. If you run it with the output panel on the right hand side (full height - panel layout is set at the bottom RHS) you will see the change in scroll action behaviour.\r\n\r\nIs there are way to modify this behaviour without me having to completely override Y.DD.DDM._setupListeners?\r\n"

Here is an example using modules from screen.yahoo.com (almost 400 new modules + the 407 modules from yui core):\r\n\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/iPOriSAS/1/edit\r\n\r\nFor what we can see in the profiling, _populateCache(), which is executed once per Y instance, it will do a one time operation to digest all the raw metadata from YUI.Env.modules, passing them thru addModule() method that will do a basic expansion of the meta without doing the recursive computation to expand the dependencies, that happens on demand.\r\n\r\nBy using the loader built of this branch, we seed a good deal of improvement, and overall a constant time to use despited the number of extra modules added thru the metas, which is exactly what we are looking for. \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nLoader keeps a member called `moduleInfo`, which is a hash with the internal meta for every module. This structure is used within the loader and from yui.js as well. This PR is proposing a shim on top of that structure to se can populate the cache for each individual module from the raw meta structure `YUI.Env.modules` when we needed. This will help to not have to walk thousand of modules as part of the initialization of the first YUI instance.\r\n\r\nA quirk on this new way of initialization is that conditional modules are not requested by any other module in the require chain, which means they will have to be analyzed before applying any operation to compute dependencies, for that, we are just warming up the conditional cache (which is normally 16 entries for yui core), instead of just initializing all core modules (400+).\r\n\r\nPerformance tests\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\ncommand: `yb src/loader/tests/performance/loader-tests.js --phantom --ref v3.14.1 --ref v3.15.0`\r\n\r\n### loader resolve core modules\r\n\t┌───────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n\t│           │  Safari (7.0.1) / Mac OS  │  Chrome (33.0.1750.117) / Mac OS  │  Firefox (27.0) / Mac OS  │\r\n\t├───────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n\t│  v3.14.1  │  44.788  ±3.7%            │  44.546  ±3.8%                    │  21.736  ±4.6%            │\r\n\t│  Working  │  189.414  ±4.4%  +323%    │  127.738  ±8.9%  +187%            │  86.822  ±3.8%  +299%     │\r\n\t│  v3.15.0  │  157.768  ±3.9%  +252%    │  109.642  ±4.7%  +146%            │  80.497  ±3.9%  +270%     │\r\n\t└───────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n### loader resolve application modules\r\n\t┌───────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n\t│           │  Safari (7.0.1) / Mac OS  │  Chrome (33.0.1750.117) / Mac OS  │  Firefox (27.0) / Mac OS  │\r\n\t├───────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n\t│  v3.14.1  │  595.568  ±5.7%           │  245.833  ±7.7%                   │  231.745  ±5.0%           │\r\n\t│  Working  │  6.721k  ±3.3%  +1029%    │  3.450k  ±7.1%  +1304%            │  2.500k  ±4.3%  +979%     │\r\n\t│  v3.15.0  │  696.895  ±3.0%  +17%     │  279.307  ±4.9%  +14%             │  260.851  ±3.8%  +13%     │\r\n\t└───────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n### caculate dependecies\r\n\t┌───────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n\t│           │  Safari (7.0.1) / Mac OS  │  Chrome (33.0.1750.117) / Mac OS  │  Firefox (27.0) / Mac OS  │\r\n\t├───────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n\t│  v3.14.1  │  87.696  ±3.8%            │  78.881  ±4.2%                    │  44.247  ±4.4%            │\r\n\t│  Working  │  306.211  ±3.0%  +249%    │  217.144  ±8.9%  +175%            │  154.839  ±3.1%  +250%    │\r\n\t│  v3.15.0  │  224.967  ±2.7%  +157%    │  132.550  ±7.0%  +68%             │  110.696  ±3.9%  +150%    │\r\n\t└───────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n### loader constructor with global cache\r\n\t┌───────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n\t│           │  Safari (7.0.1) / Mac OS  │  Chrome (33.0.1750.117) / Mac OS  │  Firefox (27.0) / Mac OS  │\r\n\t├───────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n\t│  v3.14.1  │  1.159k  ±4.6%            │  402.577  ±4.5%                   │  419.501  ±4.0%           │\r\n\t│  Working  │  35.813k  ±3.5%  +2990%   │  9.923k  ±7.8%  +2365%            │  12.131k  ±3.6%  +2792%   │\r\n\t│  v3.15.0  │  1.203k  ±3.0%  +4%       │  406.346  ±4.1%  +1%              │  435.124  ±3.6%  +4%      │\r\n\t└───────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n### loader constructor without cache\r\n\t┌───────────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n\t│           │  Safari (7.0.1) / Mac OS  │  Chrome (33.0.1750.117) / Mac OS  │  Firefox (27.0) / Mac OS  │\r\n\t├───────────┼───────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤\r\n\t│  v3.14.1  │  143.610  ±8.3%           │  127.687  ±5.7%                   │  95.255  ±7.2%            │\r\n\t│  Working  │  4.830k  ±2.9%  +3263%    │  3.451k  ±12.1%  +2603%           │  2.972k  ±3.7%  +3020%    │\r\n\t│  v3.15.0  │  138.078  ±8.1%  -4%      │  135.419  ±6.8%  +6%              │  91.891  ±5.6%  -4%       │\r\n\t└───────────┴───────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘'

1520,'',"request for an alternative to Y.Promise.all which always resolves\nI run into multiple situations, where I am batching promises, but always want the resolve-callback, even if one promise rejects.\r\n\r\nLet me explain why:\r\n\r\nSituation 1:\r\nI extended gallery-storage-lite to make all its functions return promises. When retrieving an item that is not in the localstorage, Y.ITSAStorage.getItem() rejects.\r\nHowever, I need to load multiple items simultanously and only handle those who are in the local storage:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nY.Promise.all(Y.ITSAStorage.getItem('item1'), Y.ITSAStorage.getItem('item2')).then(\r\n   function(items) {\r\n       var item1 = items[0],\r\n             item2 = items[1];\r\n   },\r\n   function() {\r\n        console.log('oops, not all items are in the localstorage');\r\n   }\r\n);\r\n```\r\nNow, when item1 is inside the localstorage while item2 is not, Y.Promise.all() rejects.\r\n\r\nSituation 2:\r\nI created dialogboxes that return promises. For instance: Y.confirm() returns a promise that resoves when the user presses 'YES' and rejects when the user presses 'NO'. To speedup loading data from the server while still waiting for the dialogprompt whether the user really want its data, I could do something like this:\r\n```js\r\nY.Promise.all(Y.io.getJSON('/foo'), Y.io.getJSON('/bar'), Y.confirm('want to load BAR as well?')).then(\r\n   function(items) {\r\n       var foo = items[0],\r\n             bar = items[1];\r\n   },\r\n   function() {\r\n        console.log('oops, user doesn't want BAR');\r\n   }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created a function Y.Promise.allFulfilled which is like Y.Promise.all but always resolves:\r\n```js\r\nY.Promise.prototype.allFulfilled = function (values) {\r\n    var Promise = this;\r\n    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\r\n        if (!Lang.isArray(values)) {\r\n            reject(new TypeError('Promise.all expects an array of values or promises'));\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        var remaining = values.length,\r\n              i = 0,\r\n              length = values.length,\r\n              resolvedresults = [],\r\n              rejectedresults = [];\r\n\r\n        function oneDone(index, resolved) {\r\n            return function (value) {\r\n                resolvedresults[index] = resolved ? value : null;\r\n                rejectedresults[index] = resolved ? null : value;\r\n\r\n                remaining--;\r\n\r\n                if (!remaining) {\r\n                    resolve({\r\n                        resolved: resolvedresults,\r\n                        rejected: rejectedresults\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (length < 1) {\r\n            return resolve({\r\n                        resolved: resolvedresults,\r\n                        rejected: rejectedresults\r\n                    });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        for (; i < length; i++) {\r\n            Promise.cast(values[i]).then(oneDone(i, true), oneDone(i, false));\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI would love to see something like this as part of Y.Promise.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMarco"

1418,'',"Properly ignore Date tests with bad dynamic input\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is the correct fix for #1353 and not a complete reversion, as in #1414.\r\n\r\nFeature detection is used to determine whether a browser has an implementation of `(new Date()).toString()` that correctly matches the date formatting required by the test.\r\n\r\nFor more details on this issue, please also reference the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://tech.bluesmoon.info/2008/09/date-inconsistencies-in-javascript.html\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nThis explanation is also available in the comments of the related tests for future reference.\r\n\r\nCertain tests are ignored on browsers where `(new Date()).toString()` has a format that's incorrectly suited for the provided format string.\r\n\r\nThe reason why these tests need to use `(new Date()).toString()` is due to the fact that this code tests timezone parsing in `Y.Date.parse`, and we need to make sure that this code will pass regardless of what timezone we run these tests in.\r\n\r\nIn all other browsers, `(new Date()).toString()` outputs the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSun Oct 27 2013 11:24:18 PDT-8000\r\na   b   d  Y    H  M  S  z\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the target format that we want to test, which is correct. Since we need it to work across timezones, we can't hard code this string, and we need to provide a specific Date in UTC time, requiring the use of `Date.UTC()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in IE, `(new Date()).toString()` outputs the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSun Oct 27 11:24:18 PDT 2013\r\na   b   d  Y  H  M  S   z\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the format of the string is incorrect, the test will fail, which is the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have two options:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure this test works across every browser, but only in one timezone.\r\n2. Make sure this test works on most browsers, but in every timezone.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we decided to make the test work in most browsers, but be ignored in IE, so that developers across the world can still develop on YUI successfully.\r\n\r\nAlthough this test would fail in IE, this does not change the correctness of the code - a string in the correct format of `%a %b %d %Y %T GMT%z` will be parsed  correctly regardless.   \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nReverting all of the work done in the following commits:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/yui/yui3/commit/02edfa676095eb9c78516eb24ac90d8f5ec7a3cb\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/yui/yui3/commit/0dff07d29e478901b873a6654515a12cd6746fdd\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/yui/yui3/commit/cf663b78e79444abfb8605d786c57f0f2bbdb521\r\n\r\nIs the incorrect solution in resolving the failing tests.  \r\n\r\nThe work done in these commits is also relevant to the other Intl work being done on the team, and should be a part of this release.  The correct resolution to the failing tests is the one available inside of this PR, which is to split up the timezone-specific tests and ignore them if the dynamic input (`Date.toString()`) does not provide the date format that we are attempting to test."

That way we maintain feature\r\n   parity for polyfills and other vendor scripts.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(function (global) {\r\n    // this is a very common pattern for polyfills\r\n    global.bar = 1;\r\n})(this);\r\n\r\nYUI.add('foo', function (Y) {\r\n     // Y.config.global.bar === 1;\r\n}, '', {});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn nodejs, `Y.config.global` is `global`, while on the browser, it is `window`.

1341,'','AsyncQueue: the firing of the \'complete\' event is inconsistent\n### What the documentation says\r\n\r\nAccording to the [API documentation](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/AsyncQueue.html#events): \r\n> complete: Event fired after the last queued callback is executed.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not clear here if the `complete` event should be fired when there is no callback to run (empty queue) or if `stop()` has been called (emptied queue).\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Library documentation](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/async-queue/) (bottom of the page): \r\n> complete: fired after the last callback is finished executing. **NOT fired after stop()**.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### What is really happening\r\n\r\nWith YUI 3.13.0, the `complete` event is fired whether the queue has run to completion or the `stop()` method has been called.\r\n\r\nThis behavior on `stop()` is due to the changes I made in this [pull request](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/541) ([in this commit](https://github.com/yui/yui3/commit/cf55606)).\r\n\r\nAt that time, I had no idea that the `complete` event was maybe not expected to be fired when `stop()` is called and in fact I thought the opposite was true.\r\n\r\nSo I fixed it for rather complicated cases (where `stop()` is called from inside a callback), but I forgot one simple case, similar to this one : \r\n```javascript\r\nq = new Y.AsyncQueue(function () {}, {\r\n   fn: function () {},\r\n   timeout: 10\r\n});\r\nq.on(\'complete\', function () { console.log("fired!"); });\r\nq.run();\r\nq.stop();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `complete` event is NOT fired today in this case.\r\n\r\n --------------\r\n\r\n### What should we do?\r\n\r\nMy question is : \r\n\r\n1. should I fix this missing case (it\'s easy, I have a [PR ready](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/1342))\r\n1. should I fix the behavior on `stop()` to NEVER fire a `complete` event\r\n\r\nIf solution 1. is preferred, I can update the docs accordingly with something like:\r\n> complete: Event fired when there is no remaining callback in the running queue. Also fired after stop().\r\n\r\nThis behavior is what I _personnally_ expect from the AsyncQueue, since calling `stop()` is often part of the basic lifecycle of the queue, and I\'m expecting to have a way to be noticed when the queue has finished its work (whether it has run to completion or has stopped).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\n'

1325,'',"`domready`, resolves #851 and #853\nThis fixes both  #851 and #853. Here's a copy/paste of what's going on with `domready` from #853:\r\n\r\n 1. Load http://jsbin.com/epejey/8 into any browser, excluding IE. The `domready` event fires extremely late, due to a really slow loading image. This is incorrect, as `domready` is supposed to fire when the document itself is ready to be manipulated (this is before images, stylesheets, and frames have finished loading). \r\n\r\n 2. The `DOMContentLoaded` event is incorrectly added in `event-ready-base.js`, when it should've been added to the core (addition of the `load` event is rightfully placed in core already, which is good). This means the `DOMContentLoaded` event won't get added until after the event module has loaded, and by then, it's too late.\r\n\r\n 3. As a result of the aforementioned, `domready`'s callback won't fire until the page has completed loaded, images and all.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs far as testing goes: the `domready` event isn't really tested in the library. Testing whether `domready` really fires is easy, but it is harder to test whether it fires *before* the `load` event, like it should. In order to do this, we would need a really large resource (an image, for example) and have it try downloading in the background. This will block the `load` event from firing. In addition to this, the test would need to be in a file of its own, as a unit test relying on image loading cannot be done in the midst of dozens of other tests. This might be more trouble than what it's worth.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nCredits to @kingback for providing the fix for this issue."

1235,'','Selleck-based solution for fixing flaky example tests\nI was trying to come up with a solution to make it easier to mock the data that we have for our user guide examples, so that the tests won\'t fail if they hit an external API like the GitHub API or YQL, and the external APIs fail.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the idea that I came up with.  We want to be able to still build our user guide examples the usual way (for the YUI Library website), but we also want to be able to replace parts of the examples with mocked versions if we want to test them in CI.\r\n\r\nWe can do that by adding a new key to YUI\'s `project.json` file called `testEnv`, and changing the value of that depending on whether we\'re inside a test environment or a real environment.\r\n\r\nFor example, here\'s how we\'ll change App\'s GitHub Contributors example.  The problem with GitHub Contributors right now is that GithubSync calls the GitHub API, which is rate-limited and often fails in CI because of that.  In `app-contributors-js.mustache`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// -- GithubSync ---------------------------------------\r\n{{#testEnv}}\r\n    {{>app-contributors-js-github-sync-test}}\r\n{{/testEnv}}\r\n{{^testEnv}}\r\n    {{>app-contributors-js-github-sync}}\r\n{{/testEnv}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, if the `testEnv` variable is set in `project.json`, then GithubSync is replaced by the mocked version of GithubSync, which will provide mock data resembling the Github API instead of actually calling it.\r\n\r\nInside of other tests, like the YQL example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'node\', \'yql\', function(Y) {\r\n\r\n    {{#testEnv}}\r\n        // Overwrite Y.YQL with a partial that provides mock data while testing.\r\n        // This could also be a call to an `echoecho` server instead.\r\n        {{>simple-yql-source-js-test}}\r\n    {{/testEnv}}\r\n    \r\n    var res = Y.one(\'#res\'),\r\n        zip = \'90210\';\r\n    \r\n    Y.YQL(\'select * from weather.forecast where location=\' + zip, function(r) {\r\n        var el = Y.Node.create(\'<div class="mod"></div>\');\r\n\r\n        el.set(\'innerHTML\', \'<h2>Weather for \' + zip + \'</h2>\' + r.query.results.channel.item.description);\r\n\r\n        res.setHTML(el);\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lets us solve all of the flaky test problems, and still lets us generate the correct examples for the website.  Inside a test environment, to generate the docs with the mocked objects, we can just use `selleck --meta` to override the `testEnv` variable.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you guys think that this might be a possible solution to this problem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

1185,'','Advanced Number and list formatting\nThis adds advanced number and list formatting. Because of the large data size, after discussions with the YUI team, locales other than the root locale have been removed for now. Any additional locales can be added later as required, or be made available through the gallery if possible.\r\n\r\ndatatype-number-format currently offers a limited number formatting API. The new module datatype-number-format-advanced extends this feature to support more locale dependent behavior. The parameters like prefix, suffix and separators to define how to format the numbers are now automatically determined according to the locale and the style parameter set by the user, instead of forcing the user to define it every time.\r\n\r\ndatatype-list-format adds support for formatting lists. For example, the array ["US", "UK", "Canada"] when passed to Y.Array.format() will return "US, UK and Canada" for English. The output differs according to the locale.\r\n\r\nEventually, when we add message formatting, these modules will be used by the message format module to format numbers and lists. We also plan to add date formatting modules later.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions asked during previous pull request were:\r\n\r\n1. Who will use these features?\r\nInternationalization is a key requirement for Yahoo properties as well as any application/service used by a growing majority of the world. The internationalization code offered with this pull is designed to use international standards and make YUI the best option for use in all JS code. Without this enhancement, jquery has significantly more advanced internationalization features. \r\n\r\n2. Why should this functionality be in YUI core instead of the gallery?\r\nWe are looking to have this code in YUI core as correct internationalization becoming more important due to the growing number of international users. Yahoo needs to have this as a core competency of YUI. Having it as an option leaves limited functionality as the default core behavior.\r\n\r\n3. Who will maintain these features and the massive amount of metadata associated with them?\r\nCLDR is the Common Locale Data Repository. It is an open source project that collects and maintains current standards for many different internationalization feature data sets. This is the basis of what we are using for date formats (absolute, relative & duration) , number formats, etc.\r\nBy leveraging CLDR data, YUI can stay abreast of current standards without needing to maintain, organize or collect the information.\r\nRegardless, as mentioned earlier, the locale data has been removed from this pull request. Only the root locale remains. Any other locale can be added later on as required, or made available through gallery if possible.\r\n\r\n4. Does this align with the emerging spec?\r\nThis is making use of the ECMA code where possible. The current ECMA spec does not include all of the different internationalization features being worked on here.\r\n\r\n5. What is the core use case this PR aims to provide?\r\nImproved internationalization support for Yahoo properties. As a byproduct of this, it would also improve any user of the open source code that intended to gain access to additional language/region markets.\r\n'
1184,'','Add support for new elements in `event-valuechange`\nAs discussed in #1157:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for two groups of new elements for `event-valuechange`, `<select>` elements with `<option>` choices, and any element with the `[contenteditable="true"]` attribute.\r\n\r\nThe `<select>` elements work nearly the same way as `<input>` and `<textarea>`, which basically checks their `value` attribute for any change.  There are some performance cheats involved in the polling loop to improve performance on IE6 without having to resort to using `node.get(\'value\')`, and have been fully tested.\r\n\r\nThe `[contenteditable="true"]` (or `[contenteditable=""]`) elements act differently, and fires a change when their `innerHTML` property changes.  For now, there isn\'t support for elements that inherit `contenteditable` from a parent element.  It\'s something I could add, but I\'m worried about the performance hit on having to search up the DOM tree to check whether or not the element has a parent node that has `[contenteditable="true"]`.  If that\'s something that might be useful, though, let me know, and I\'ll see if I can find an efficient way to do that.\r\n\r\nThis was tested on all A-grade browsers (including IE6) and passes all unit tests and manual tests for each one.  There were no performance hits even after adding the new functionality in.\r\n\r\nThe goal for this enhancement is mainly so that we can use the `valuechange` event to efficiently detect form element changes when implementing two-way data-binding later on.'

1177,'','potential security issue with the documentation example of JSONP\nI was at the OWAP conference in Hamburg in August (http://appsec.eu), and Stefano di Paola, one of the security researches and Javascript experts, showed me a potential vulnerability in the recommended way of using JSONP in YUI, documented in http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/jsonp/.\r\n\r\nThe section "Customizing the JSONP URL" http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/jsonp/#format gives an example where a simple textual substitution with Y.Lang.sub is used to add text to the URL.  This is wrong and may be dangerous if the substitution values are coming from the unsafe sources (such as parts of the URL – cgi parameters, hash etc.) because the insertion is done in the URL ((that is, into the URL context), and the injected data must be URI escaped.\r\nConsider this PoC (for time reasons, I skip the server side and just used example.com as JSONP target which does not provide any valid response – still, it should be sufficient to demonstrate the issue).  We will take the replacement value from the location.hash.\r\n\r\nThe unsafe example code is this one:\r\nfunction prepareJSONPUrl(url, proxy, username) {\r\n     return Y.Lang.sub(url, {\r\n         callback: proxy,\r\n         name: username || "user" // <<< THIS PART\r\n     });\r\n}\r\nhttp://dmitris.github.io/domxsstest/jsonptest.html#dmitris – this may be the intended usage, "dmitris" replaces the "name" placeholder, and the URL generated and fired is:\r\nhttp://example.com/dmitry/service.php?callback=YUI.Env.JSONP.yui_3_12_0_1_1378823866555_4\r\n\r\nSo far so good - but if the attacker sends a user the URL like:\r\nhttp://dmitris.github.io/domxsstest/jsonptest.html#evil?callback=alert(123)\r\nThe YUI will generate and call the following URL:\r\nhttp://example.com/evil?callback=alert(123)/service.php?callback=YUI.Env.JSONP.yui_3_12_0_1_1378823817521_6\r\n\r\nYou can see that we were able to inject the "callback" CGI parameter (now there are two of them, and it depends on how the server handles the double arguments).  Technically, it is called "HPP" - HTTP Parameter Pollution [1]\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is fixed on this page:\r\nhttp://dmitris.github.io/domxsstest/jsonptest_fixed.html#evil?callback=alert%28123%29\r\nWhere the value added to the URL is wrapped in encodeURIComponent:\r\nfunction prepareJSONPUrl(url, proxy, username) {\r\n     return Y.Lang.sub(url, {\r\n         callback: proxy,\r\n         name: encodeURIComponent\r\n(username) || "user"\r\n     });\r\n}\r\nIn this case, all the injected data becomes just part of the path – probably, making it invalid – but there is only one \'?\' character and one callback CGI parameter with the intended value:\r\nhttp://example.com/evil%3Fcallback%3Dalert(123)/service.php?callback=YUI.Env.JSONP.yui_3_12_0_1_1378823936336_6\r\n\r\nI hope it makes sense! :)  We should fix the documentation to avoid people copying code from the official YUI documentation and creating vulnerabilities on their pages.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the description of Stefano di Paola\'s talk: http://sched.appsec.eu/event/294be88bd5614ca31a83e2056404732f#.UhfiPhb52fQ ,\r\nyou can find the online recording on https://www.its.fh-muenster.de/owasp-appseceu13/rooms/Grosser_Saal/high_quality/OWASP-AppsecEU13-StefanoDiPaola-JavascriptlibrariesinsecurityAshowcaseofrecklessusesandunwittingmisuses_720p.mp4\r\nHe mentioned briefly this YUI case alongside of similar problems in other JavaScript libraries.\r\n'

The example I put together on the Chromium bug tracker used only native history controls, but I wanted to show an example of how you can run into the same thing when using YUI. I created a Gist (https://gist.github.com/roblund/6430494) containing a simple page. You should be able to reproduce the issue by using the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Save the Gist to a file (start up something like a python simplehttpserver to serve the page)\r\n2. Load the test page in Chrome\r\n3. On the first load, we will drop into the 'if' and run HistoryHTML5.add() which should append our query string to the URL and add our history state to the stack.\r\n4. Click 'some link' and go to the test2 page (which is just blank page with no JS)\r\n5. Click Back in the browser\r\n6. Verify you are sent back to test.html.\r\n7. Click 'some link' again and go to the test2 page.\r\n8. Click Back in the browser\r\n9. You will be sent to test3.html which is the href in your base tag.\r\n\r\nYUI is calling replaceState when the page is loaded after clicking back and a 'null' is sent in as the third parameter, which corresponds to URL. You can see this on line 107 of https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/history/js/history-html5.js. Chrome/Webkit is then incorrectly then taking the href from the base tag and adding that to the history stack instead of using the current url (which is what Firefox and Internet Explorer do).\r\n\r\nThe reason this is relevant to YUI is that I believe you could potentially workaround this bug in Chrome/Webkit by changing the 'null' on line 107 of https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/history/js/history-html5.js to instead be 'document.URL'. In my limited testing this seems to avoid the Chrome/Webkit issue completely, because you are explicitly setting the url that is sent into replaceState.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything that doesn't make sense, please let me know and I'll be happy to clarify."

The following example illustrates the issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar route = /\\/foo\\/(bar)?/;\r\n\r\n// In modern browsers:\r\nconsole.log(route.exec(\'/foo/\')); // => ["/foo/", undefined]\r\n\r\n// In IE < 9:\r\nconsole.log(route.exec(\'/foo/\')); // => ["/foo/", ""]\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn the context of route dispatching in Router, the result of `exec()`-ing the regex route path is assigned to `req.params`. Since request parameters are dealing with strings, I think a fine compromise is to always make sure they are an array of strings and coerce `undefined` to empty string, both are falsy values.'

1067,'ericf',"Router should accept a route config object in addition to a string or regex path\nCurrently, `Y.Router#route()` only accepts a string or regex `path` as its first argument, it then processes that into a route config object. It would also be useful if Router accepted an already processed route config object provided by the caller.\r\n\r\nTo coordinate routes between the server (like Express) and client, it's important to make sure subtle things like whether to use optional trailing slashes are preserved. The best way to do this is to provide `Y.Router` with the same regex path that's used server side. The problem in doing so is when a regex path is used, you have to use unnamed params in route handlers. Allowing the following would resolve this issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar routeConfigFromServer = {\r\n    path  : '/posts/:postId',\r\n    keys  : ['postId'],\r\n    regexp: /^\\/posts\\/(?:([^\\/]+?))\\/?$/i\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar router = new Y.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.showPost = function (req, res, next) {\r\n    // ...\r\n};\r\n\r\nrouter.route(routeConfigFromServer, 'showPost');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow `keys` to be supplied with the `regexp`, giving the route handlers named params."

1063,'ericf','Add support for mapping route params to regexps or functions for processing\nIt\'s desirable to both use string-based routes with named params, e.g., `"/posts/:id"`, and assign some processing to route param values, e.g., `id` should be a number.\r\n\r\nThis adds a feature to Router to support mapping named params to regular expressions or functions.

Adding another callback/middleware isn\'t the end of world, but it gets repetitive since it has to be added to every route (or to a common middleware stack). Having to switch to using regex route paths sucks because you lose named request parameters, and those route paths are hard for humans to parse.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n- [x] Write initial implementation\r\n- [x] Add support for functions\r\n- [x] Write tests which fully cover feature\r\n- [x] Test in all YUI Target Environments\r\n- [x] Fill out API docs\r\n- [x] Update user guide\r\n- [x] Add HISTORY.md entry\r\n'

Using iframe (the old approach)\r\n2. As an inline (so called "HTML5") editor\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, the architecture of the Editor has been changed a bit. It now has two containers - the old one iframe and a new one, called "Content Editable".\r\nBoth are plugins and extend Plugin.Base.\r\n\r\nFollowing and old conversation with @davglass, and to achieve backward compatibility, if there is no container specified, EditorBase will load the old iframe.\r\n\r\nHere is an example how YUI Editor could be transformed to an inline editor:\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n    var myEditor = new Y.EditorBase({\r\n        content: \'<p>Hello world.

If we don\'t plug it, we will have an editor with an iframe.\r\n\r\nThere are no API changes, so people should have 100% backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nTo prove that, let\'s use a Toolbar from YUI Gallery, for example [Itsa EditorToolbar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/itsatoolbar) by @ItsAsbreuk:\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n     var myEditor = new Y.EditorBase({\r\n        content: \'<p>Hello world.

1029,'','Perf Test Refresh\n# Perf Test Refresh\r\n\r\nA project I\'ve been working on recently has been to standardize and automate YUI\'s performance testing.  While the tools to do this are not yet released (soon), there are some modifications that will need to be made to YUI\'s current performance tests. Included in this pull request are proposed modifications and alternative ideas.\r\n\r\nFirst...\r\n\r\n## Problems with the current tests\r\nCurrently the source tree has various HTML+JS combinations that comprise performance tests ([an example](https://github.com/yui/yui3/tree/master/src/app/tests/performance)), mostly using [benchmark.js](http://benchmarkjs.com/). While this has worked fine for manual testing against your current tree, it\'s proven to be a little challenging to test in more automated and dynamic ways.\r\n\r\nTo summarize a few of the issues with current tests:\r\n\r\n  * Requires lots of boilerplate, which increases the overhead of writing new tests, thus reducing the test coverage.\r\n  * Test files are difficult to parse. What is boilerplate and what is test code?\r\n  * Written specifically for Benchmark.js, so they aren\'t portable\r\n\r\nThe parsing aspect of it is very important since we\'re reconstructing performance tests with different seeds for cross-version testing.  Also, since performance metrics can guide development priorities, we need to continually experiment with different testing strategies and tools to ensure the results are as reliable as possible. Unit testing is simple pass/fail, but performance testing asks "How good is your code?"  The answer to that question is continually evolving.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nTo address this, we need a slighty new way of writing tests.  Since the compiler takes care of writing all the boilerplate for you, the only thing we\'re interested in are the basic ingredients for a performance test: (1) suite metadata and (2) test functions.\r\n\r\nThere are two directions we can go here, imperative or declarative (if you will).  The files contained in this pull request represent the declarative approach.\r\n\r\n### Option A\r\n\r\n  I started with this approach as it is just a simple reflection of what the objects are parsed into inside the test compiler.  The general idea is you start with an object, and fill it with a few basic properties all perf tests have.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\t// config.js\r\n\t{\r\n\t\ttitle: \'My test suite\',\r\n\t\ttests: [\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\ttitle: \'My test\',\r\n\t\t\t\tfn: function () {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t// do something\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThere are some additional properties you\'ll find included in this PR (check em out), but that is the most basic example and only contains the required fields.\r\n\r\n### Option B\r\n\r\nThe imperative approach would involve wrapping parts of these tests in an API.  Something like:\r\n\r\n\t// config.js\r\n\tvar suite = new PerfTest(\'My test suite\');\r\n\r\n\tsuite.addTest({\r\n\t\ttitle: \'My test\',\r\n\t\tfn: function () {\r\n\t\t\t// do something\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nSo, it would probably look similar to the [Benchmark.js API](http://benchmarkjs.com/docs).  Likely just a subset of it.  In this world, a testing tool would have a simple API to collect each component of a suite, then assemble it into a format ultimately similar to the declarative approach.\r\n\r\nFor example, the collection class would look something like:\r\n\r\n\tfunction PerfTest (title) {\r\n\t    this.suite = {\r\n\t    \ttitle: title,\r\n\t    \ttests: []\r\n\t    };\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tPerfTest.prototype.addTest = function (test) {\r\n\t\tthis.suite.tests.push(test);\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nSimple, but it will get a little more complex as the instance will need to support declaring `setup`/`teardown`, prep HTML, etc.\r\n\r\n## Preference?\r\n\r\nWe can easily go either direction.  For a true apples to apples comparison, here is the `node-create` test written in [Option A](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/new-perf/src/node/tests/performance/node-create.js), [Option B](https://gist.github.com/derek/1b64542f9b679b454b54), and the [old format](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.11.0/src/node/tests/perf/node-create-benchmark.js).\r\n\r\nFrom the compiler\'s perspective, it all ends up looking like **Option A** before test construction, so the question just comes down to how do developers want to write tests?\r\n\r\nMy personal preference is to go with **Option A**.  Why?\r\n\r\n * It is a simple, unopinionated approach\r\n * When perf testing, we spend most of our time tweaking library code, not writing tests, so elegance takes a backseat to simple and straight-forward.\r\n * It doesn\'t blur the lines between implementation vs configuration\r\n * Is dead-simple to parse, so it can be turned into anything\r\n * Doesn\'t require learning a new API, just a few field names\r\n * One suite per file (forced) is nice, the filename becomes the slug\r\n\r\nBut if the preference is to go with **Option B**, I can write a simple parser to crawl through these files and reconstruct the suites with the new TBD API.\r\n\r\nDiscuss...'

I've added this functionality to `event-tap` and I'd like a code review of it. Provided that you guys think that I have approached this in the right manner.\r\n\r\n**Update**: The fix to `Y.Event._GESTURE_MAP` (980d0e010eb14bef7ca8585bd66757f03ab8c8c8) also adds dual listener functionality to `event-gestures`. \r\n\r\nI believe that it fixes these issues: https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/682, https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/683, https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/631\r\n\r\n## What's in this PR\r\n\r\nHistorically, `event-tap` has had some shortcomings:\r\n\r\n1. If you subscribed to the `tap` event, you couldn't call `event.preventDefault()` within the callback.\r\n2. `tap` didn't work on devices which support both touch and mouse inputs. This is because of a bug in `event-touch`. \r\n\r\nBoth of these issues have been resolved in this pull request. \r\n\r\n## Adding dual listener support\r\n\r\nThe part of this pull request that I would like the most feedback on is how I have handled the dual listener issue. This is how it works (Refer to the code [in this commit](https://github.com/tilomitra/yui3/commit/9cbc2f655e46c69aa9ed56506cc4225eaabca7b9))\r\n\r\n1. By default, subscribing to a `tap` event adds a listener for `[mousedown touchstart]` if `win.ontouchstart` exists. \r\n2. Inside the `mousedown touchstart` callback, it checks to see whether a `mouse*` event or a `touch*` event occured. If touch, it sets up more `touch*` subscriptions, else if mouse, it sets up `mouse*` subscriptions. This prevents the `tap` event from firing twice, in case a browser fires mouse events after touch events (as shown below):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntouchstart\r\ntouchend\r\nmousedown\r\nmouseup (this won't fire an additional tap event)\r\nclick (this is captured by modifying the fire() method)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll probably make more sense to look at the code: https://github.com/tilomitra/yui3/commit/9cbc2f655e46c69aa9ed56506cc4225eaabca7b9\r\n\r\nLooking forward to some feedback!\r\n\r\n## Tested on\r\n\r\nTested on Android 4.0.x, iOS6, IE6,7,8,9,10, Latest FF, Safari, Chrome\r\n\r\nNote: I simulated the dual listener functionality by turning on the touch events flag in Chrome.

949,'',"Modified Y.Object.keys() shim for Android 2.3.x. Fixes #658.\nThis PR fixes issue #658, which had several failing tests in the OOP test suite.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue was that the test cases used `Y.Object.size(object)` to perform assertions, which uses `Y.Object.keys(object)` underneath.  Android 2.3.x (including the latest version, 2.3.7) has a buggy implementation of `Object.propertyIsEnumerable(prop)`, which considers the object's `prototype` to be enumerable.\r\n\r\n[A similar problem](https://github.com/yui/yui3/commit/6ed148777f04d35c42c9370c8108484f14be78a2) was solved by @rgrove with Opera 11.50 before.  However, Opera 11.50 did not have a native version of `Object.keys()`, which the Android 2.3.x browser does.  In that case, `Y.Object.keys()` is just an alias to `Object.keys()`, but since the native Android version is buggy, the tests fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that issue by using the YUI shim when `_isProtoEnumBug` is truthy, as well as fixing `YUITest.hasNoKeys()`, which also has the same issue."

939,'','Y.Array.dedupe performance and documentation\nWhen dedupeing an array, `Y.Array.dedupe` uses an object, or hash, to store already visited strings. So, when iterating, `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is used to make sure the string currently being visited will not collide with inherited properties of the hash (such as `constructor`, or `toString`). \r\n\r\nThis is good, however because of ES5, there is a better way. We can avoid calling the expensive method `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` N times, where N is the length of the array, by creating our hash using `Object.create(null)`. \r\n\r\n`Object.create(null)` will inherit absolutely nothing, and so we avoid having to ever call `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, which impacts performance, especially as the length of the array gets larger and larger.\r\n\r\nI tested this idea here on a small array (of size 16): http://jsperf.com/y-array-dedupe\r\nThe results appear promising, even on a small array.\r\n\r\nI have added:\r\n* Feature detection of `Object.create`, so it can be used by `Y.Array.dedupe` when present.\r\n* Unit test to ensure inherited properties (from `Object.prototype`) are not colliding with existing array items.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nhttp://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/classes/Array.html#method_dedupe\r\n\r\nI also propose a change in the documentation of this method.

The hashing of numbers will generally produce the same effect and results as if we were hashing strings. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the documentation can be changed to state it can used on an array of **only strings** *or* an array of **only numbers**. An appropriate unit test demonstrating this idea has been added. Thoughts?'

In these browsers, `String.prototype.trim` isn\'t present, and YUI falls back to a polyfill using the `\\s` whitespace class to do the trimming.

It appears to be fixed in the latest version of FF, though.\r\n\r\nI added:\r\n* Unit tests to better detect these specific issues, as the current ones were too simple and did not include the weird and obscure pieces of whitespace.\r\n* Utilization of the `Y.Lang._isNative` method to better feature detect trim, trimLeft, and trimRight (not sure why it wasn\'t being used before, as it will protect YUI from detecting another library\'s shim).\r\n* Detection of whether `trim`, `trimLeft`, and `trimRight` actually do the right thing and trim everything (FF 3.5 issue, possibly others).\r\n* Most importantly, a corrected whitespace class, to ensure all pieces of whitespace are caught and replaced in YUI\'s polyfill.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIf anyone\'s interested, here is what ECMAScript 5.1 considers trimmable:\r\n\r\n*Whitespace*\r\n* `\\u0009` - Tab\r\n* `\\u000B` - Vertical Tab\r\n* `\\u000C` - Form Feed\r\n* `\\u0020` - Space\r\n* `\\u00A0` - No-break space\r\n* `\\uFEFF` - Bye Order Mark\r\n* Other category - Zs: All Unicode space separators are placed under a category called "Zs", which can be extracted from here (http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt, where the category of the code point is the 3rd column), or easily seen here: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Zs/list.htm\r\n\r\n*Line Terminators*\r\n* `\\u000A` - Line Feed\r\n* `\\u000D` - Carriage Return\r\n* `\\u2028` - Line Separator\r\n* `\\u2029` - Paragraph Separator'

We have some time before Sprint 8 code complete, so don't need to rush it.**\r\n\r\nDuring 3.11.0pr1 evaluation (thanks to everyone who did that) AlloyUI came across a real-world issue due to the Base order of operations changes introduced by https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/629\r\n\r\nI believe it's resolvable, without having to rollback the fix for the issue above, with the resolution leaving us in a better place going foward.\r\n\r\nHowever, the resolution has a much larger probability of Extension developers having to upgrade their custom Extension impls, so I think it warrants broader YUI committer and user feedback, especially from people writing component Extensions.\r\n\r\nSome details first, and I'll end with the choices on the table, for discussion/feedback.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nFor,\r\n\r\n```\r\n[A]~[ExtA]\r\n |\r\n[B]~[ExtB]\r\n\r\nB extends A.\r\nA mixes in ExtA.\r\nB mixes in ExtB.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order of operations, as it pertains to constructors, attr setup, and initializers, is described below:\r\n\r\n## FLOW 1: Beginning of Time - 3.10.3\r\n\r\nManual chained, B Constructor -> A Constructor, kicks off:\r\n\r\n1. ExtA Constructor\r\n2. A ATTRS (valueFn, setters, getters, validators called)\r\n3. Ad-Hoc attrs\r\n4. A initializer\r\n5. ExtA initializer\r\n6. ExtB Constructor\r\n7. B ATTRS (valueFn, setters, getters, validators called)\r\n8. B initializer\r\n9. ExtB initializer\r\n\r\n### THE BUG HERE\r\n\r\n* If B overrides setter/getters etc. for A's ATTRS, they can't access B's ATTRS, since B ATTRS are set up in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue we were attempting to fix with the 3.11.0pr1 change to add all attributes in one shot. The bug, although not common, is present in the wild, and is difficult to grok for component developers.\r\n\r\n## FLOW 2: 3.11.0 PR1\r\n\r\nManual chained, B Constructor -> A Constructor, kicks off:\r\n\r\n1.

ExtB initializer\r\n\r\n### BACK COMPAT ISSUE\r\n\r\n* Existing **B ATTRS** may rely on **A initializer, ExtA initializer** having run. This was the expected low risk change, as documented. Noone seems to have hit this in real-world impls.\r\n* Existing **B ATTRS** may rely on **ExtB constructor** having run.\r\n\r\nThe last issue was hit by AlloyUI in the PR. It's similar to the issue above, but maybe more common, since it's encapsulated in the same class. That is, it seems like it would be common for B's ATTRs to depend on ExtB's constructor.\r\n\r\n## FLOW 3: Potential Fix? 3.11.0 - The End of Time.\r\n\r\nManual chained, B Constructor -> A Constructor, kicks off:\r\n\r\n1. ExtA Constructor\r\n2. ExtB Constructor\r\n3. Ad-Hoc attrs\r\n4. A + B ATTRS (valueFn, setters, getters, validators called)\r\n5. A initializer\r\n6. ExtA initializer\r\n7. B initializer\r\n8. ExtB initializer\r\n\r\n### BACK COMPAT ISSUE\r\n\r\n* Existing **B ATTRS** may rely on **A initializer, ExtA initializer** having run.\r\n* Existing **ExtB Constructor** may rely on **A ATTRS, A initializer, ExtA initializer** having run.\r\n\r\nWe hit a set of older extension constructors in the library (WidgetPositionAlign, WidgetButtons, etc.) which did depend on the second issue - A's ATTRS having been set - and failed.\r\n\r\nHowever all of these were older extensions, written before `initializer` support for extensions was added, so the constructor was the only place to stick this code. The intention was always to update these to use `initializer` when time/priorities permitted.\r\n\r\nOnce this was done, **all** library unit test code passed.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Solution Options\r\n\r\n**A.

Stick with FLOW 2**\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n* Doesn't seem to be that common.\r\n\r\n   None of the library code had it. None of the other PR adoptors seem to have it. Alloy UI only hit it in their older deprecated components.\r\n\r\n* Won't require folks to revisit their Extension implementations.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n* The order of operations, compared to FLOW3 is still messy to grok.\r\n* Although not hit by anyone so far, logically, it seems like it would be a more common scenario (for B's ATTRS to depend on ExtB's constructor), so we may have to do this again post GA if this proves to be true.\r\n\r\n**C. Push on to FLOW 3**\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\n* This seems like the most grokable, maintainable flow moving forward.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\n* There is a strong possibility that Extension developers (outside of library code, which we'll take care of), will need to move code from their Extension's constructors to their Extension's `initializers` as we had to do for the older out of the box Extensions in this pull request.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# My Take\r\n\r\n* I'd like to move to Flow 3\r\n\r\n   * It's the cleanest story going forward.\r\n   * However, we can't force that change without some level of general YUI community consensus, due to the potentially wider upgrade impact to Extension developers.\r\n\r\n* I don't think we can stick with Flow 2 for 3.11.0.\r\n\r\n   * I think it's not going to be as uncommon as unit testing/PR adoption suggest, and I'm hesistent to do two rounds of this, if it does turn out there are more occurrences in the wild, post GA.\r\n   * It should be noted that the performance improvements in 3.11.0pr1, won't be impacted if we roll back. Most of that comes from the event bypass.\r\n\r\n* In the absence of feedback/general consensus, I'll roll back to Flow 1 for Sprint 8, and pick this up again later.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** While providing feedback don't let my take influence your opinions. That is, I'd be perfectly fine to roll back the change also, and revisit this again in another sprint. I'm just trying to gauge opinion on the benefits vs. potential upgrade impact of Flow 3, in the sprint 8 timeframe.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see what impact Flow 3 would have on your code bases, this pull request/branch should give you a way to try it out (hence the build files committed).\r\n\r\nIt's not written for performance at this point (has one more loop around classes than I'd like), but the flow/functionality is the expected final functionality.\r\n"

I ran into Calendar weirdness again lately and decided to just clean this stuff up.

But [JavaScript's Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) counts days as 0-7, starting from Sunday. What to do?\r\n3. `very_short_weekdays` are two-letter abbreviations for column headers. `datatype-date-format` has three-letter abbreviations for far more languages.

I'm happy with the Attribute change solution.\r\n\r\n## Model Changes\r\n\r\nNeeded to change Model's override of `_defAttrChangeFn`, in order to remove one of the 2 hacky pieces in Base/Attribute, and change it to override `_setAttrVal` instead to support it's coalesced change event support. Both of these methods are currently private, and should probably remain so.\r\n\r\nIn general the coalesced change support, and a large part of what Model does with attribute change events could effectively be in an Attribute extension (that is, you may want that same coalesced change functionality for anything Attribute based) so I'm fine with this coupling for now. Ideally we should move it into an Attribute extension, sitting closer to the Attribute code anyway.\r\n\r\n## Numbers\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements are in the thread mentioned above, and are pretty significant (`set` operations showed 4x improvement, over 3.10.0 in the case of no listeners - making a 16x improvement over 3.9.0 overall), but I'll re-run them with current code and post them.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTests are coming, for Base init and Attribute change events with/without listeners, as well as the new CustomEvent methods, but wanted to get this out there for review sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n**All** current unit tests pass, which is the main indicator of quality I've been using:\r\n✔ [Total]: Passed: 11009 Failed: 0 Total: 11100 (ignored 91)\r\n\r\n## Preview Release\r\n\r\nThis pull request along with https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/781 both have the potential to impact real-world customizations, although it's expected to be rare.\r\n\r\nGetting them out in a Preview Release, early in the sprint is important, along with adoption of this release, to see if there are real world issues which would cause us to back off from these changes."

I just followed the general async structure of the original test, but could be made simpler maybe (for example, not sure if the nested wait is required).\r\n\r\nInvolves the following:\r\n\r\n1. Replaces `wait(fn, arbitraryTimeout)` calls with wait/resume where applicable.\r\n2. Removes custom timeouts from `wait(timeout)` calls. The 200ms delay was causing tests to fail in IE8, under load, probably the result of a poll interval not being able to kick within the timeout period.\r\n3. Tries to force `window.focus()` before executing each test, in order to fix blur related errors in IE8 (similar to the issue we have with FF focus/blur tests failing when not focused).\r\n4. Groups the rest of the tests which do need some kind of `wait(fn, arbitraryTimeout)` because they\'re waiting for a non-event (e.g. "valuechange should not fire") into a separate test case, and based the arbitraryTimeout on the POLL_INTERVAL + BUFFER, where BUFFER is higher for known flaky browsers (i.e. IE).\r\n5. Added code to force `_stopPolling` on `tearDown`, to avoid having the last interval bleed over into the next test.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n* Did 10 test runs on Yeti, with the following browsers. No failures (assuming FF is the focused window):\r\n\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Safari (6.0.1) / Mac OS\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Safari (6.0) / iOS 6.0\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Chrome (27.0.1453.93) / Mac OS\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Firefox (21.0) / Mac OS\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Internet Explorer (8.0) / Windows 7\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Internet Explorer (9.0) / Windows 7\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Safari (4.0) / Linux\r\n   ✓ Agent completed: Safari (4.0) / Linux\r\n  ✓ Agent completed: Internet Explorer (8.0) / Windows XP\r\n  ✓ 135 tests passed! (15 seconds)\r\n\r\n* Prior to these changes, if I bumped up the POLL_INTERVAL, to something like 1000ms, I\'d see all the arbitraryTimeout tests consistently fail, validating the need for the above changes. When I do that with the above changes, everything passes.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Firefox window focus flakiness issue still applies in general (that is, tests will fail if FF doesn\'t have focus). The tests weren\'t ignored in gecko previously, so left them that way, and they seem to have been passing in CI.'

I'll remember not to do that next time.\r\nThe issue:\r\nThe marker on Dial (the dark spot that moves around the ring as you drag the handle) was sticking intermittently when crossing min/max.\r\n \r\nSituations where this happened:\r\n* min and/or max were at a North position on the dial. and,\r\n* handle was quickly dragged past min or max and then back into range. \r\n\r\nThe fix is limited to moving some code out of a function that was called for both drag the handle and click the ring, and putting it in the mousedown on the ring function.\r\n\r\nUnit tests passed on the following:\r\nIE6, IE7, IE8, IE9, IE10-win8\r\nFirefox, Chrome, Safari\r\niOS 5, iOS 6\r\n\r\nManual tests passed (no stickiness) on same browsers as above.\r\n\r\nDial does not have unit tests yet that test dragging. This still needs to be done, so manual testing is the only way to assure the fix is working. "

681,'apipkin',"[DT] Added isHidden method to determine if a cell or row is visible\nFor the cell editor, I had to hide the editor when the cell being edited is scrolled away.  The code to determine if the cell is still visible relies too heavily in the particulars of the way scrolling is implemented so it could not reasonably remain with the cell editor with such a strong dependency.\r\n\r\nThe only public method that `datatable-scrollable` currently offers is `scrollTo`.  I added `isHidden` to determine if the cell or row is visible or not.\r\n\r\nTo do so I broke apart the part of the code from `scrollTo` that locates the element to be scrolled to and put it in a shared `_locateTarget` method.\r\n\r\n`isHidden` takes the same argument as `scrollTo` plus a `partially` flag to allow to ask whether the element is totally hidden (the default) or just partially covered.\r\n\r\nI am not sure about the names.  Should I provide `isHidden` or `isVisible` ?  Perhaps it should be `isElementHidden` (it handles cells and rows so how could I refer to either?).  Also, `_locateTarget` got that name because the local variable in `scrollTo` was called `target` but I can't claim the name is a good one.  Suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nWhile adding tests I noticed that  `_locateTarget` could not locate a row by the `clientId` of the model it represents as the API docs claims so I added that.\r\n\r\nI am also unsure of whether to provide that `partially` argument to `isHidden` is the right thing to do or if it would be better to provide different returns, for example, false or 0 for not hidden, true or 2 for totally hidden and 1 for partially hidden (which also evaluates to true if you are not particularly concerned). Or 0, 1 and -1.\r\n\r\nI also found that `scrollTo` doesn't really scroll fully into view a cell beyond the right edge when there is a vertical scroll bar.  `scrollIntoView` ignores that the vertical scroll bar is there so the cell gets at least partially hidden behind it.  It makes `isHidden` fail because on all of the other edges, if you scroll to a cell, it gets completely visible while in this case, it gets at most partially visible.\r\n\r\nI wonder if providing a `region` (like `node.get('region')`) would be a good idea."

Merge A and B\'s ATTRS, to capture overrides (B sets a new default value for example).\r\n\r\n2. Loop around all classes:\r\n\r\n     2a. Add A\'s ATTRS from merged ATTRS\r\n     2b. Call A\'s initializer\r\n     2c. Add B\'s ATTRS from merged ATTRS\r\n     2d.

It should just be an extra "in" in cases where attribute configs don\'t have a default value - so we should still maintain benefits for the 80% case. I\'ll update with numbers.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nPrior to the Attribute perf changes, we used `state.addAll()` to set up\r\nthe initial config for an attribute while adding it. For performance\r\nreasons this was replaced by simply setting `state.data` directly, to\r\nconsciously avoid iteration and mix costs for the initial add.\r\n\r\nHowever there are use cases, such as CandleStickSeries\' relationship\r\nbetween it\'s `graphic` and `upcandle` attributes where this causes\r\na regression.\r\n\r\n`graphic` is defined by a superclass, but it\'s setter is overridden by\r\nCandleStickSeries. The overridden setter sets the `upcandle` attribute,\r\nwhich only exists on CandleStickSeries, not on the superclass.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the value of `upcandle` is set while the `graphic` setter\r\nis executed, before the `upcandle` attribute is formally added.\r\n\r\nIn older versions, we\'d add the `upcandle` attribute later, when\r\nprocessing CandleStickSeries attributes, and since we just merged,\r\nwe\'d maintain the original set value. In the new version, since we\r\nset `state.data` directly, the original value gets blown away.\r\n\r\nFIX\r\n\r\nThe localized fix, aims to re-introduce the \'merge\' behavior, if\r\na value already exists, while still trying to keep the optimized\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThe longer term fix, which is targetted for the next release is\r\nto remove the class-by-class attribute setup and just added all\r\nattributes in one shot, which not only avoids the issue, but will also likely result in more performance benefits.\r\n\r\nTESTING\r\n\r\nAll library tests pass through yogi --no-cli.

In addition, laying out forms comes with a fair share of cross-browser-compat issues. Luckily, Normalize takes care of these. CSSForms wraps up these rules (in `forms-core`) and makes it easy for people to create forms by adding class names. Since CSSNormalize is part of core, it makes sense for low level building blocks such as menus, forms and tables to be part of core too.\r\n\r\nWhile working on YUI CSS, I tested this on IE7+, Latest FF, Chrome & Safari, iOS6. \r\n\r\n//cc @msweeney @jconniff @ericf '
574,'',"Attribute and Base performance improvements\n# Description\r\n\r\nThis is a set of 10 or so key commits (a lot of the others are merge commits, benchmark cleanups), aimed at optimizing normal `AttributeCore` and `BaseCore` operations (instantiation, get/set).\r\n\r\nThe changes are discussed in the context of `AttributeCore` and `BaseCore`, because it's a good way to isolate event from non-event costs. However anything we do for `AttributeCore` and `BaseCore`, also help `Attribute` and `Base`, as seen from the numbers below. For example, `ATTRS` aggregation, or `get()` work the same way regardless of event or no event. Working on them in the `AttributeCore/BaseCore` context, just helps highlight the changes without the event impact.\r\n\r\nIndividual commits as well as HISTORY.md have detailed information about the areas targeted, changes involved, and incremental performance improvements.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in reviewing this, I would recommend reviewing the changes on a commit by commit basis, guided by the descriptions in each commit.\r\n\r\n# Important Back-Compat Note\r\n\r\nOne of the key performance changes in this pull request is the change to cache the result of the static `ATTRS` aggregation which occurs when you instantiate a `Base` based object.\r\n\r\nPrior to this pull request, we'd re-aggregate `ATTRS` for every instance created, which was where we spent about 1/3rd of the time required for `Base` instantiation. Now, for the 2nd instance onwards we re-use the cached aggregation improving performance substantially. Since `ATTRS` is a 'class' centric concept, that seemed reasonable.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a result of this change, if you're touching the `ATTRS` collection on a 'class' directly, after it's first defined, there's potential for breakage (this seems to be rare - library code didn't have any such patterns). The cache won't know about your modifications if they come in after the first instance of that class is created. If you do have such code in your custom components, it will need to be changed to use the new `modifyAttrs()` static method. See Base's HISTORY.md for further details.\r\n\r\nAs part of the pull request (or preview release), we'd be interested if your code does in fact need to be updated to use the static `modifyAttrs`, and we'll refine the solution accordingly. We're hesitant to over-engineer it, without that input.\r\n\r\nThe related commits are:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sdesai/yui3/commit/699cc325d063aa44678ec3dbd9ac863f2b75d0b5\r\nhttps://github.com/sdesai/yui3/commit/83f1e984dec53e4d14bc5744641405d224e069c7\r\n\r\n# Numbers\r\n\r\nOn Chrome 25, compared to 3.8.1 (and probably 3.9.1), we're seeing the following improvements:\r\n\r\nThis branch:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>x Change</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new BaseCore()</td><td>3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>basecore.set()</td><td>3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>basecore.get()</td><td>4</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>x Change</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new MyBaseCore() [extends BaseCore]</td><td>3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>MyBaseCore with 10 simple value attributes</td><td>2</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>MyBaseCore with 20 varied attributes (using perf. best practices)</td><td>2</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>MyBaseCore with 10 simple value attributes - set()</td><td>3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>MyBaseCore with 10 simple value attributes - get()</td><td>4</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nWhen combined with the work in https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/572, we're seeing:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Benchmark</th><th>x Change</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>new Base()</td><td>4</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>base.set()</td><td>4</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>base.get()</td><td>5</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n**All** library tests through `yogi test --no-cli` pass:\r\n\r\n`[Total]: Passed: 10731 Failed: 0 Total: 10820 (ignored 89) (7 minutes, 59 seconds)`\r\n\r\nAdditionally **All** library tests pass on:\r\n\r\n   * IE8\r\n   * Safari6/Mac\r\n   * Safari6/iOS6\r\n   * FF19\r\n   * Chrome26\r\n\r\nAside from a couple of known testing and environment exceptions (jsonp/yeti, datatable date formatting/IE and a Y.clone(nodeInstance) bug, which @ericf has a fix for) which also fail on dev-3x.\r\n\r\n# Preview And Release Timelines\r\n\r\nGiven the low-level nature of these changes, and the customizations on top of them, it would be beneficial to get a preview release based on these changes (event-perf-nolisteners + attrs-perf) out and have it get some real-world integration (especially for users with customizations on top of Base), with a week or two of reaction time prior to release, to clean up anything which comes up out of the pull requests and PR.\r\n"

This small fix modifies the <code>_show</code> and <code>_hide</code> methods to set or remove a node's <code>hidden</code> attribute, which has a more semantic meaning and is supported by screen readers. It also has the benefit that supporting browsers will hide the content (equivalent to <code>display: none</code>) without having to specify the CSS manually (by the user or framework) on the node itself. For older browsers that do not automatically hide the content via the hidden attribute, the style <code>display: none</code> still still needs to be used, however the state will still be communicated properly with the hidden attribute. This minor fallback could be done via conditional loading but I felt that it was too small of a change to warrant the overhead, and so I left it in the node-view.js unless it is suggested otherwise.\r\n\r\nI also updated the <code>_isHidden</code> method to check for the hidden attribute, added toggle to the Showing and Hiding example, and a section on how to check for visibility using the hidden attribute.\r\n\r\nThis request includes the changes to node-view.js, along with the unit tests, API docs, and example docs."

The root cause of this phenomenon is because \'run\' always gets the next callback, thus always evaluate the \'until\' function of the next callback. But \'run\' doesn\'t need to get the next callback at all when the current callback execution says not to continue running the queue (for exemple when \'pause\' or \'stop\' has been called).\r\n\r\n3. when pause() and run() are called "synchronously" by a callback execution, the run() call doesn\'t do what we expect (= resume) but triggers an extra execution of the callback. This can be fixed by keeping a reference somewhere to know if we are inside a callback execution, so that the run method behaves adequately (c399b92), fixes issues [#2528602](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2528602) / [#2531758](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2531758) / [#2531844](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2531844)\r\n\r\nShould I file separate bug reports on http://yuilibrary.com/ for the first 2 issues that have not been reported previously ?

In fact we only know of one explicit area of backwards *incompatibility* as it\'s described below:\r\n\r\n#### Inappropriate Touching of ATTRS\r\n\r\nMany of these performance improvements are made possible by clever caching of the static ATTRS configs aggregation, this way work isn\'t needlessly done per-instance. Because of this we are evaluating the need for a static API(s) for mutating previously defined `ATTRS`, it would be something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nY.Foo = Y.Base.create(\'mine\', Y.Base, [], {}, {\r\n    ATTRS: {\r\n        bar: {value: \'BAR\'}\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar foo1 = new Y.Foo();\r\nY.log(foo1.get(\'bar\')); // => "BAR"\r\n\r\n// Modifies Y.Foo.ATTRS.foo. This type of operation should be rare.\r\nY.Foo.modifyAttr(\'foo\', {value: \'bar\'});\r\n\r\nvar foo2 = new Y.Foo();\r\nY.log(foo2.get(\'bar\')); // => "bar"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself doing the above, that has some code smell to it. That said, if we find that it is very common for people to modify previously defined `ATTRS` *after* creating an instance, then we\'ll add the static `ATTRS` mutation methods.\r\n\r\n#### Report Back-Compat Issues\r\n\r\n**Please** report any backwards compatibility issues you run into when working with this code. While it has run the gauntlet of our unit tests, dropping this into real production app code is invaluable to changes like these.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps: Event Performance\r\n\r\nThis pull request **only** tackles changes in `Y.Attribute` and `Y.Base`. The next phase of significant performance improvements to YUI will come through refactoring the event system. The following lists captures our high-level ideas and goals for event performance changes:\r\n\r\n* Firing of events with no subscribers should be as close to a no-op as possible.\r\n* Make event publishing lazier and defer object creation to fire phase.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n- [x] Add description to this pull request.\r\n- [x] Add 3.8.1 vs. latest benchmark numbers.\r\n- [ ] Add `ATTRS` mutation method to `Y.Base` which clears caches.\r\n- [x] Fix minor issue in complex attribute values, e.g. "foo.bar".\r\n- [ ] Fix issue with attribute value cloning of nodes in IE.\r\n- [ ] Add API and user guide docs for changes.\r\n- [x] Forecast minor back-compat breakage.'

447,'','YUI3, meet normalize.css\nThis pull request brings in [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) into YUI3. The thoughts and discussion behind this pull request were discussed on [this hangout](http://youtu.be/Ow1j5UMqTWc). Here\'s an earlier [wiki with my thoughts](https://github.com/tilomitra/yui3/wiki/Normalize.css-discussion).\r\n\r\n### Use-cases of CSSReset, CSSBase, and Normalize.css\r\n\r\nCurrently, people who are using these modules are probably doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n- Using CSSReset to get a clean slate without any styles\r\n- Using CSSReset and then CSSBase to add some basic styles.\r\n\r\nThe first use-case is untouched by this pull request. People can keep using CSSReset. However, bringing in Normalize.css means that people don\'t need to do the CSSReset + CSSBase combo. Normalize.css is a more modern alternative to CSSBase, and contains a superset of the rules that were present in CSSBase. \r\n\r\n### Why not in the gallery?\r\n\r\nPulling Normalize.css into core allows us to deprecate CSSBase, which is pretty old. Also, all the YUI CSS stuff such as [Forms](http://tilomitra.github.com/cssforms/), [Tables](http://tilomitra.github.com/csstables/), [Lists](http://tilomitra.github.com/csslist/), and [other stuff](http://jconniff.github.com/cssextras/) depend on normalize.css, so it makes to put something this foundational in the core.\r\n\r\n### What\'s in the pull request?\r\n\r\nAs part of the earlier discussion, this pull request includes a naked normalize.css and a contextual normalize.css that affects HTML elements that are children of an element marked by `.yui3-normalized`. \r\n\r\nThere\'s a Makefile in there that imports normalize.css similar to how it works with `Y.Handlebars` (just run `make all`). It assumes that you have cloned the [normalize.css repo](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) in the same directory as yui3/. There\'s also a little NodeJS script that writes `normalize-context.css` by parsing through `normalize.css`. Docs and examples attached with some basic example and manual tests. \r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n- [x] Change module name to `cssnormalize` to follow CSS-only module naming convention.\r\n- [x] Add missing newlines to ends of files.\r\n- [x] Add copyright and license info to all imported files.\r\n- [x] Forecast `cssbase` deprecation.\r\n- [x] Scope `html\xa0input[type="button"]` in contextual normalize while avoiding [Android breakage](https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/447#issuecomment-13568432).\r\n- [x] Add content to HISTORY.md\r\n'
445,'',"A+ compatible Promises\nThis is a refactor of @lsmith's code in https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/241. Previous discussions and the evolution of this code can be seen in https://github.com/juandopazo/yui3/pull/4.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a new module called `promise` instead of `deferred`. Promises are already a complex concept to understand and teach, and deferred objects make it harder. This refactor internally keeps a similar relationship between objects as in deferreds+promises, but it tries to hide it with a new API.\r\n\r\nThe new way to create promises is by using the `Y.Promise` constructor and passing it a function in which you initialize promise. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/**\r\nWaits for a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that gets\r\nfulfilled when done waiting.\r\n\r\n@param {Number} ms Number of milliseconds to wait\r\n@return Promise\r\n*/\r\nY.wait = function (ms) {\r\n  return new Y.Promise(function (fulfill) {\r\n    setTimeout(fulfill, ms);\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\nUnderneath there's another object called `Y.Promise.Resolver` which does the same thing as the old `Deferred`.\r\n\r\n### A+ status\r\nAs far as interoperability goes the status of the A+ spec is very stable. There are other aspects that are still under discussion but are not essential to getting a compatible implementation. Mostly the A+ group is looking for the best API for creating promises and cancelling them. `new Y.Promise(fn)` was born in [Microsoft's implementation for WinJS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx) and mostly adopted by the A+ group, with some differences. This implementation follows the same pattern as the WinJS one.\r\n\r\nCancelling is a topic still under discussion and that it should at some point be added to the YUI implementation because some async operations are usually cancelled. For example: XHR and setTimeout.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nI've added tests that cover the basic functionality of promises, `when` and `batch`. Tests for `when` and `batch` should be enough, but the ones in the [A+ test suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests) are much more comprehensive. It'd be  great to run them to the YUI test runs. They're written in Jasmine which doesn't help, but translating to YUI Test would double the effort or guarantee that they become outdated.\r\n\r\n#### Running the A+ Test Suite\r\nSteps for running the test suite:\r\n  1. Create a folder somewhere\r\n  2. Copy the `package.json` file [that installs YUI and the tests](https://gist.github.com/juandopazo/4755591)\r\n  3. Copy the test adapter file (see the same gist), build the Promise module and point YUI in the adapter to the correct location of that module\r\n  4. Run `npm install .`\r\n  5. Run `npm test`\r\n\r\nCan we add the A+ tests as a CLI test? What would it take?\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\nI'm starting to work on the docs. Nothing to see yet. I plan on:\r\n* Covering some background on promises as simple async operations chaining, value wrappers and async control flow managers\r\n* Showing how to create promises\r\n* Explaining how `then`works, how to chain promises and deal with failures\r\n* Explaining Y.when and Y.batch\r\n* Adding at least two examples. A simple one like `Y.wait` and a more complex one like writing your own Y.Node plugin that chains transitions."

429,'','Y.Tree: An awesome generic tree data structure\n# Y.Tree\r\n\r\nThis is an import of the [SmugMug Tree](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-tree) gallery module, a generic tree data structure that provides a fast and friendly API for working with hierarchical data (such as the items in a Menu, TreeView, or even a DOM node).\r\n\r\n## What it does\r\n\r\nA tree has a root node, which may contain any number of child nodes, which may themselves contain child nodes, ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nChild nodes (`Y.Tree.Node`) are lightweight function instances which delegate to the tree for all significant functionality, so trees remain performant and memory-efficient even with thousands and thousands of nodes.\r\n\r\nDon\'t believe me? Here\'s a stress test that demonstrates the SmugMug TreeView gallery module (which uses `Y.Tree`) loading and rendering 12,780 nodes in about 100ms: <http://jsbin.com/udayaz/54>\r\n\r\nThe `Y.Tree` class doesn\'t expose any UI, but the following gallery modules are examples of components that extend `Y.Tree` and provide a UI:\r\n\r\n* [SmugMug Menu](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-menu)\r\n* [SmugMug TreeView](https://github.com/smugmug/yui-gallery/tree/master/src/sm-treeview)\r\n\r\n## Why YUI needs it\r\n\r\nTree structures are inherently useful for representing many types of data that web developers work with frequently. YUI currently has components such as Model and ModelList that are good for working with flat lists, but these components are awkward to use and perform poorly when shoehorned into representing hierarchical data.\r\n\r\nSome of the most obvious potential use cases for a tree structure would be a treeview widget or a hierarchical menu. Here are a few other possible use cases to spur your imagination:\r\n\r\n* A future version of `Y.NodeList` could adopt `Y.Tree` to represent a hierarchy of DOM nodes.\r\n* `Y.App` could adopt `Y.Tree` to represent a hierarchy of views.\r\n* A parser might use `Y.Tree` to represent a parse tree.\r\n\r\n## Act now and get these extensions for free!\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes several `Y.Tree` extensions that can be used to mix additional functionality into a tree:\r\n\r\n* **`Y.Tree.Labelable`**: Adds the concept of text or HTML "labels" to nodes, like you might see in a treeview or menu.\r\n\r\n* **`Y.Tree.Openable`**: Adds the concept of openable/closeable/toggleable nodes to a Tree, along with related events and methods.\r\n\r\n* **`Y.Tree.Selectable`**: Adds the concept of selection state to a Tree, along with related events and methods. In single-select mode (the default) one node at a time may be designated as selected. In the optional multi-select node, multiple nodes may be designated as selected.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a plugin, `Y.Plugin.Tree.Lazy`, which can be plugged into any Tree that mixes in the `Y.Tree.Openable` extension. This plugin adds a convenient API for lazy-loading children of a node the first time that node is opened.\r\n\r\n## Other stuff\r\n\r\n`Y.Tree` and friends have full test coverage and detailed API docs. There currently is not a user guide or examples, but I hereby promise to write those if there\'s a consensus that this PR should be accepted.\r\n'

If it is passed to the setter or validator,\nthey can decide whether to accept or not a value.\n\nIt is like using _set for changes to read-only attributes,\nusing _set instead of set allows you to override the read-only.\nIn this case, passing the options argument to setter and \nvalidator, allows you a conditional setting based\nin the value and the origin of it.\n\nFor example, the setter on an attribute might accept\nand parse a string containing numbers when the source\nis the UI because input boxes only return strings.\nThe same setter might reject values set from unspecified\nsources if they are not real numeric.  Likewise,\nit might accept 0 for false and 1 for true when the source\nis a remote database while accepting only Booleans from\nother sources.  When setting a date, the extra argument\nmight indicate the format the date string is in.\n\nI have added those opts to both the setter and the validator\nso they can decide on accepting or rejecting the value\nbased on the origin of the data.\n\nI wonder if I should add the option to allow the third argument\nto set to be a string and, in that case, make an object with the\n"src" property set to that value.  Thus, these two would be the same:\n\no.set("attrA", true, "UI");\no.set("attrA", true, {src:"UI"}); \n\n------------------------------------\nProvided an extra test to try the setter with the extra argument\nThis change should be fully backward compatible.\nChanged the landing page.\n\nInadvertently I stripped trailing spaces on the changed sources,\nwhich JSHint complained about anyway.

There are situations where observability is not required and its overhead can be avoided; the most interesting of which is when using YUI Models in a Node.js server.\r\n\r\nModel.Observable is a mixable class extension for Model.Base, which uses BaseObservable and enables developers to add observability to their basic models.

This patch will make scrollbars accurately update to a page's current offset upon page change, and a follow-up patch (in the future) will make the scrollbar width/height update to accurately reflect the current page's height/width.\n\nIn my opinion this is not a blocker for 3.7.0 GA.  It can be considered safe as a minimal merge, or also delayed until 3.7.1 (if released) or 3.8.0.  dual-axis paginated instances are a new feature, so this is not considered a regression in current behavior, just a quirk with a new feature."

Trac ticket [#2532745](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2532745/)\n\nScrollView's Paginator plugin previously respected a `minVelocity` value to trigger a page change, but this was left out of the 3.7.0 cleanup as a preference for more simple code.  However, it was discussed that this should probably be reintroduced.  \n\nAlso left out was a drag distance threshold as a minimum for page change.  So for example, on a 500px widget, previously the distance dragged would need to be >=250px to trigger a page change, otherwise it would snap back.  But in 3.7.0 this could be triggered with just a 1px drag.  Arguments can be made for either behavior, and it should probably be a configurable value, but to respect backwards compatibility until it can be researched further, it has been reintroduced.\n\nThese two related updates are primarily confined to two methods inside `paginator-plugin.js`\n\n  * `_beforeHostFlick` - Reacts to the flick behavior, which is now responsible for handling pagination instead of deferring to the drag listener.  Additional logic has been added to determine ability to scroll on the paginator's axis, as well as determining pagination direction.  This method will prevent ScrollView's `flick` listener from firing, since the post-drag action is already determined (a page).\n  * `_afterHostGestureMoveEnd` - Reacts to drag events.  Additional logic added to determine the distance of the drag, and compare that to the halfway point of the page node's width/height.\n\nWhen reintroducing code/logic, it can sometimes be helpful to compare old vs new.  They are not directly comparable because different `on`/`after` calls, as well as the host methods doing slightly different things as well. But for the curious:\n\n3.6.0 [_flickFrame](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.6.0/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L181)\n3.7.0 [_beforeHostFlick](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L340)\n\n3.6.0 [_onGestureMoveEnd](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.6.0/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L167)\n3.7.0 [_afterHostGestureMoveEnd](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L261)\n\nA few additional notes\n  * In the more aggressive flick testing for this update, an unrelated issue was discovered where the widget's `_maxScroll{X/Y}` values could be reset to zero, subsequently preventing normal interaction with ScrollView.  This was due to some logic specifically for dual-axis instances but was not wrapped in a check to ensure it was dual-axis.  Fixed, [line #426](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L426).\n  * To provide maximum time for review before code freeze, full testing will be done in parallel to code review.

230,'ericf','Y.Template and Y.Template.Micro - Generic template API and simple ERB/Underscore-style JavaScript templates\nWhile working on a new widget recently, I found myself wanting a string-based templating solution that was more advanced than `Y.Lang.sub()` or `Y.substitute()`, but without the overhead of `Y.Handlebars`. I needed support for interpolation, if/else branching, and looping, but only for a few very small templates. Underscore-style templates (more familiar as ERB-style templates to Rubyists) seemed like exactly the right fit.\r\n\r\nThese commits add a new `Y.Template` class which provides a generic template engine API, and a `Y.Template.Micro` static class which provides a simple micro-templating engine. `Y.Template` can be used to compile, precompile, render, and revive precompiled templates using Handlebars or `Y.Template.Micro`.\r\n\r\n### Y.Template\r\n\r\nUsing with `Y.Template.Micro` (the default template engine):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template\', function (Y) {\r\n    var micro = new Y.Template(),\r\n        html  = micro.render(\'<%= data.message %>\', {message: \'hello!\'});\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing with Handlebars:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template-base\', \'handlebars\', function (Y) {\r\n    var handlebars = new Y.Template(Y.Handlebars),\r\n        html       = handlebars.render(\'{{message}}\', {message: \'hello!\'});\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the API docs for further details.\r\n\r\n### Y.Template.Micro\r\n\r\nProvides simple ERB/Underscore-style micro-templating. Can be used standalone or via `Y.Template`.\r\n\r\nWithin a template, `<% ... %>` is used to insert a block of JavaScript code, `<%= ... %>` evaluates and prints an expression as HTML-escaped output, and `<%== ... %>` evaluates and prints an expression as raw, unescaped output. Properties on the data object passed to a template function are made available within the template on the `data` variable.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a simple template that renders a list:\r\n\r\n```rhtml\r\n<ul class="<%= data.classNames.list %>">\r\n    <% Y.Array.each(data.items, function (item) { %>\r\n        <li><%= item %></li>\r\n    <% }); %>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here\'s the code to compile the template and render it (assume `listTemplate` is a string containing the template above):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template-micro\', function (Y) {\r\n    var compiled = Y.Template.Micro.compile(listTemplate),\r\n        html;\r\n\r\n    // Render the compiled template to HTML.\r\n    html = compiled({\r\n        classNames: {list: \'yui3-list\'},\r\n        items     : [\'one\', \'two\', \'three\', \'four\']\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // And again, with a different set of data.\r\n    html = compiled({\r\n        classNames: {list: \'yui3-list\'},\r\n        items     : [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\']\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrecompilation is supported too, so Micro can be used to precompile templates at build time or on the server.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// `precompile()` returns a string containing JavaScript code that will evaluate\r\n// to a template function. It can be written to a file, served to a remote\r\n// client, etc.\r\nvar source = Y.Template.Micro.precompile(listTemplate);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n`Y.Template.Micro` is significantly faster than both Underscore and Handlebars at both compiling and rendering templates. See http://jsperf.com/y-template-vs-others/6\r\n\r\n### Running Locally\r\n\r\nThe built `template`, `handlebars`, and `yui` modules are intentionally not included in this pull request in order to keep the diffs clean. Before testing this change, you\'ll need to build them.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd src/handlebars && shifter\r\n$ cd src/template && shifter\r\n$ cd src/yui && shifter\r\n```'

In most cases developers only need to provide a value for `root` when sub-classing `Y.Model`, and only provide a value for `url` when sub-classing `Y.ModelList`.\n\nThis module began its life in the Gallery where it had to time be put through its paces and grow into something very useful which should be a core module in YUI:\nhttp://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/model-sync-rest\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nYUI().use(\'model\', \'model-list\', \'model-sync-rest\', function (Y) {\n \n    var User = Y.Base.create(\'user\', Y.Model, [Y.ModelSync.REST], {\n        root: \'/users\',\n    });\n \n    var myUser = new User({id: \'123\'});\n    myUser.load(); // Will GET the User data from: "/users/123"\n \n    myUser.set(\'name\', \'Eric F\').save(); // Will PUT the User to: "/users/123"\n    myUser.destroy({remove: true}); // Will DELETE the User at: "/users/123"\n \n    var newUser = new User({name: \'Eric Ferraiuolo\'});\n    newUser.save(); // Will POST the User data to: "/users"\n \n});\n```\n\n### Running Locally\n\nI explicitly did not commit the build files or the Loader metadata update, when trying out these changes locally, do the following:\n\n```bash\n$ cd src/loader/ && make\n$ cd ../app/ && ant all\n```\n\n### Todos\n\n* <del>Initial drop</del>\n* <del>Add info to Model\'s user guide</del>\n* <del>Add support for `getURL([action], [options])` signature</del>\n* <del>Add support for `_substituteURL(url, [data])` signature</del>\n* <del>Break out `Y.io` callbacks into prototype methods</del>\n* <del>Add more unit tests in increase code coverage</del>\n'

Preserves backwards compatibility, and adds the ability to have a fallback system when specifying skins and does not require\r\nthe user of the framework to have to remember which modules support which skins:\r\n\r\n    YUI({\r\n        skin: {\r\n            order: 'night,sam'\r\n        }\r\n    }).use('test', 'calendar', function (Y) {...});\r\n\r\nThis tells the framework to load the first available skin in the ordered list of\r\nskins for each module in the `use` call. So for calendar it will load the\r\n__night__ skin because calendar supports it and for test it will load the\r\n__sam__ skin since it is the only skin that it supports.\r\n\r\nSince the `defaultSkin` is always included as the last skin in the ordered list,\r\nyou can also write (because the default skin is __sam__):\r\n\r\n    YUI({\r\n        skin: {\r\n            order: 'night'\r\n        }\r\n    }).use('test', 'calendar', function (Y) {...});\r\n\r\nFor a more extreme example, look at slider-base, it is the only module that supports\r\n9 skins so we could write the following and the framework will load the skins in\r\nthat order of preference. Later on, when calendar supports __round__ or\r\n__round-dark__, there would be no changes needed to the code below.\r\n\r\n    YUI({\r\n        skin: {\r\n            order: 'round,round-dark,night,sam-dark'\r\n        }\r\n    }).use('test', 'calendar', 'slider-base', function (Y) {...});\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `skins.order` property is backwards compatible which means\r\nthat changing the `defaultSkin` and using `overrides` still works as expected.\r\n\r\nMetadata for skins (see MOD_SKINS in Loader.js 46-75) generated by [comp_skins](https://github.com/ryanvanoss/comp_skins) and could be added to build files (a la requires metadata).\r\n\r\nYou can play with skin order and overrides here: http://23.21.81.23/yui3configurator/index.php, and run the existing unit tests, along with the additional tests from this pull request, here: http://23.21.81.23/yui/tests/loader/tests/index.html.\r\n\r\nConfigurator source code available here: https://github.com/ryanvanoss/yui3configurator\r\n"

98,'rgrove',"Added hasNext property to req.\nThis provides a way for route callback functions to determine if there are any matching routes after this one.\r\n\r\nAn issue came up in an app with many routes.  About half of the routes require a user to be logged in.  Instead of putting the log in check within each route, it would be far more convenient to put the log in check in one route before all the others then call next() once it has been confirmed that the user is actually logged in.\r\n\r\nCurrently the best solution for this scenario is to create a route with a regex path that matches every possible path that requires user log in.  As the app grows, that regex could become quite unwieldy.  The next best option is to use wild card routes, but there is a drawback to using wild card routes for this purpose.  If the '*' route forces a user to log in, but there happens to be a typo in the path, the call to next() won't do anything.  So they logged in for nothing.  If the app is set up to display a 404 message, a user would have to log in to see the 404.\r\n\r\nWhile user log in and 404 may be a rare occurrence, it just seems silly.  There could also be other use cases where a wild card route is used to set up something and the next route is expected to make use of the something and clean up after it.  If a next route doesn't actually exist, the clean up step won't be performed.\r\n\r\nTo make wild card routes more useful when chaining routes, a hasNext property has been added to the request object that gets passed to all route callback functions.  The hasNext property is an integer count of routes left to be dispatched after this one.  It will be 0 if there are no more routes, so req.hasRoute could be used as a simple condition to pre detect 404 errors."

To see it happening, just open the offical demo page (http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/scrollview/scrollview-paging-example.html) and make a diagonal drag (from top right to bottom left). You'll see that the scrollbar will move to the next image but the image showing up will still be the one that was showing before the drag.\r\n\r\nI've investigated a little and I believe that the problem is inside paginator-plugin.js's _beforeHostFlick method. It prevents calls to _flick but simulates them on the background, moving to the next/previous index and calling scrollTo in the end. The diagonal drag is being identified by scrollview-base.js as a flick on the y axis though, which would normally be ignored inside the _flick method if it was not being prevented and simulated by the paginator. The _beforeHostFlick method doesn't check if the gesture's axis matches the allowed flick axis though, and simulates it anyway, moving to the next index but without scrolling to it since the gesture didn't cause a scroll on the x axis.\r\n\r\nI've verified that this is fixed by just checking if the gesture axis is the same as the flick axis inside _beforeHostFlick, but I'm not sure if that's the best fix. Maybe a diagonal drag should also be considered as a horizontal flick instead of just vertical. I can organize what I have and send it later when I have some time if this isn't fixed by then though."

1718,'','research on conditional/when `after` and `before`\nPart of the alignments with ES modules will require some adjustments in our current conditional loading strategy. As today, YUI Core only uses `after` and `instead` as values for `when` property when defining a conditional module, it doesn\'t use `before` although we have tests for them, and there might be some people using it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in ES there is not `after` and `before`, only `instead`, since each module is suppose to export something, and you should not mix the export with more things that happen after or before.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the metas today, it seems like the use of `after` is hacky, and could be solved by implementing `instead`, and having a more granular approach for the things that are common for multiple modules.\r\n\r\nHere is the current meta using `after`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    "yql-jsonp": {\r\n        "condition": {\r\n            "name": "yql-jsonp",\r\n            "test": function (Y) {\r\n                  /* Only load the JSONP module when not in nodejs or winjs\r\n                  TODO Make the winjs module a CORS module\r\n                  */\r\n                  return (!Y.UA.nodejs && !Y.UA.winjs);\r\n            },\r\n            "trigger": "yql",\r\n            "when": "after"\r\n        },\r\n        "requires": [\r\n            "jsonp",\r\n            "jsonp-url"\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    "yql-nodejs": {\r\n        "condition": {\r\n            "name": "yql-nodejs",\r\n            "trigger": "yql",\r\n            "ua": "nodejs",\r\n            "when": "after"\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    "yql-winjs": {\r\n        "condition": {\r\n            "name": "yql-winjs",\r\n            "trigger": "yql",\r\n            "ua": "winjs",\r\n            "when": "after"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could have a `yql-base` that implements the shared pieces between all these 3 modules, and then having `yql`, `yql-winjs` and `yql-nodejs` to depend on it, then having `yql-winjs` as a replacement for `yql` when in `winjs`, and the same for the nodejs version. That\'s a more elegant solution, and we could finally kill the `when` property, implementing the `instead` path for all conditionals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the `yql-jsonp`, this really qualifies as an `optionalRequires`, specially if it depends on `yql-base`.

Essentially the safest thing to do is skip listing these DOM-reliant YUI modules in the `requires` list and instead `Y.use()` them inline.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there is a solution in sight. Express-YUI provides a new loading mechanism called `optionalRequires`. This makes use of an effect of the `affinity` property.

The difference being that it would be possible to introduce a new property in Y.config, similar to the debug property, but specifically aimed at deprecation warnings. This would allow them to be separated out from standard messages.\r\n\r\nHaving given it some thought, I suspect that using Y.message would be sufficient for a majority of cases and I can't really think of any reason you'd want one, but not the other."

In the case of "no change" where the display value (e.g. a form input) has changed, the View should revert the display value back to the normalized value, but since it does not receive an event, it will not do so.\r\n\r\nWhat would be nice is a change event with an additional property describing the actual resolution of the change -- true, false to indicate whether the update was performed, and a reason such as unchanged, readonly, writeonce, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAs it is, my current solution is to implement something in the view code -- prior to performing the set of the model attribute, the view\'s display is reset to the attribute\'s current value in the model, and after the asking the model to set the new value, the resulting event -- either change or error -- will cause the display to either be set to the new value or to the invalid value with an appropriate error message.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the implementation issues -- performance, whether to enhance the change event or add a new one, whether it might be an extension -- does this sound like a valid use case?  I think an event from the Model explaining why the set was rejected would not only assist in keeping the display updated, but in providing more meaningful feedback, in the form of error or warning messages, to the end user.'
1518,'','Drag and Drop Shim breaks when using Javascript fullscreen API\nIt seems the shim brought in by dd-ddm (as opposed to dd-ddm-base) breaks\r\ndrag and drop when using the FullScreen API provided by modern browsers.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this by using the slider (not required, but makes sure I\'m not doing anything dumb myself when setting up Dragging), and the gallery full screen which provides a cross-browser convenience wrapper around the fullscreen functionality (the gallery component is deprecated, but the full screen component does not seem to be the source of the problem). I then explicitly ask for the dd-ddm module to make sure the shim code is loaded (it is on by default if you use dd-ddm as opposed to dd-ddm-base which doesn\'t have the shim code). You need to ask for this as slider only brings in dd-ddm-base.\r\n\r\nIf you try to drag the slider in the example code below, it works to start with, but then fails to slide properly after you click the full screen button. The full screen api takes a dom element as essentially the top level dom element, so things that do stuff with \'body\' or other elements to get page sizing info will fail once in full screen mode, as these elements are not longer part of the rendered tree. I suspect the code using \'<body>\' in the ddm.js code from:\r\nhttp://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/files/dd_js_ddm.js.html#l2\r\nis to blame here, specifically the code in the _pg_size and _createPG functions.\r\n\r\nThe code below should reproduce the problem (either remove the dd-ddm module from the module list or uncomment the code that sets useShim to false to that either of these two things remove the problem). If it helps anyone, it seems this behaviour started in 3.7.0, as 3.6.0 seems to work (although there are a few other glitches with the slider dragging pre 3.7.0 if you place the slider in the right kind of context (absolutely positioned containers inside relatively positioned containers that seem fixed now in the latest releases).\r\n\r\nFor anyone else having this problem, accessing the private dd object and turning off the shim should work, i.e.:\r\nslider._dd.set(\'useShim\', false);\r\n\r\nOr if you are using drag and drop directly and can pass in the useShim: false flag directly, that should also work (assuming you are using the d&d in a way that doesn\'t actually need the shim).\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<title>Test</title>\r\n<script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.14.1/build/yui/yui-min.js"></script>\r\n</head>\r\n<body class="yui3-skin-sam" style="">\r\n<script>\r\nYUI({\r\n    //Last Gallery Build of this module\r\n    gallery: \'gallery-2012.05.02-20-10\'\r\n}).use(\'slider\',\'dd-ddm\',\'gallery-full-screen\', \'gallery-node-full-screen\', \'event-base\', \'node-base\', \'cssbutton\', function(Y) {\r\n \r\n  // Progressively enhance the font-size input with a Slider\r\n    var fontSizeInput = Y.one(\'#font_size\');\r\n    fontSizeInput.set(\'type\',\'hidden\');\r\n    fontSizeInput.get(\'parentNode\').insertBefore(\r\n        Y.Node.create(\'6 <span></span> 36\'),\r\n        fontSizeInput);\r\n\r\n    var slider_container = fontSizeInput.previous( "span" );\r\n\r\n    // Create a Slider to contain font size between 6px and 36px, using the\r\n    // page\'s current font size as the initial value.\r\n    // Set up an event subscriber during construction to update the replaced\r\n    // input field\'s value and apply the change to the StyleSheet\r\n    slider = new Y.Slider({\r\n        length: \'100px\',\r\n        min: 6,\r\n        max: 36,\r\n        value: parseInt(Y.one(\'body\').getStyle(\'fontSize\')) || 13,\r\n        after: {\r\n            valueChange: function (e) {\r\n            /*\r\n                var size = e.newVal + \'px\';\r\n\r\n                this.thumb.set(\'title\', size);\r\n                fontSizeInput.set(\'value\', size);\r\n\r\n                myStyleSheet.set(\'body\', { fontSize: size });\r\n                */\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }).render( slider_container );\r\n\r\n\r\n    // Uncomment the next line to \'fix\' the bug.\r\n    //slider._dd.set(\'useShim\', false);\r\n\r\n    var status = Y.one(\'#status\'),\r\n\tbutton = Y.one(\'#button\'),\r\n\tnode = Y.one(\'#node\');\r\n \r\n\tif (!Y.FullScreen.isSupported()) {\r\n\t    status.set(\'text\', \'SORRY: Your browser does not support FullScreen\');\r\n\t    return;\r\n\t}\r\n \r\n\tbutton.removeAttribute(\'disabled\');\r\n\tstatus.set(\'text\', \'YES: Your browser supports FullScreen\');\r\n \r\n\tnode.plug(Y.Plugin.NodeFullScreen);\r\n \r\n\tbutton.on(\'click\', function(e) {\r\n  \t    node.fullScreen.request();\r\n\t});\r\n \r\n\tY.on(\'fullScreen:change\', function(e) {\r\n  \t    if (Y.FullScreen.isEnabled()) {\r\n\t\tstatus.set(\'text\', \'Whoa, you went fullscreen\');\r\n\t\tbutton.setAttribute(\'disabled\', \'disabled\');\r\n\t    } else {\r\n\t\tstatus.set(\'text\', \'Back to normal\');\r\n\t\tbutton.removeAttribute(\'disabled\');\r\n\t    }\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n<div id="outer-container" style="">\r\n<div id="node" style="background-color:white">\r\n<span class="yui3-button" id="button">Full Screen</span>\r\n\r\n<div style="">\r\n<div>\r\n<label for="font_size">Font size:</label>\r\n            <input type="text" size="3" id="font_size" value="16px">\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id="status"></div>\r\n</div> <!-- end node -->\r\n</div> <!-- end outer container -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n'

1323,'','[Fix issue #1152] Enhance event-flick module with flickleft, flickright, flickup, flickdown sugar events\nThis pull request fixes [issue #1152](https://github.com/yui/yui3/issues/1152) by enhancing the `event-flick` module. \r\n\r\n## What\'s in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### `flick*` events\r\nAdded 4 new synthetic "sugar" events that developers can hook on to:\r\n* `flickleft`\r\n* `flickright`\r\n* `flickup`\r\n* `flickdown`\r\n\r\nThese events have the exact same public API as the generic `flick` event, but fire only when the `axis` and `direction` properties match up to the respective directions. \r\n\r\n### Bit of code cleanup\r\nI separated out the monolithic `_onEnd()` callback into smaller functions:\r\n* `_onEnd()`\r\n* `_isValidFlick()`\r\n* `_fireEvent()`\r\n\r\nThis helped me re-use a large portion of the CustomEvent config object when defining the new `flick*` events. These new events only overwrite the `_isValidFlick()` method. Check out \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, there was some minor code cleanup to make the code more readable.\r\n\r\n### `minDistance` default value change\r\nI made a change in the `flick` event\'s `minDistance` property. By default, its value is now `100`, so that it catches a legitimate flick, instead of a slight move of the finger. I believe it was `10` before. \r\n\r\n### Improve Test Coverage\r\n`event-flick` did not have great tests. There were only 3 of them and they probably weren\'t working correctly because the assertions were inside a custom `fire()` method. If `fire()` wasn\'t called, the tests would pass anyway, since an empty test with no assertions passes. I improved the way the tests are written and added a bunch of new tests. `event-flick` has ~98% line coverage in all browsers. I\'m not using `event-simulate` so these tests are very stable.\r\n\r\nI also added a new manual test (`flick-simple.html`).\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n* IE7-10\r\n* Latest Chrome/Safari/FF\r\n* iOS 7\r\n* Android 4.0.3\r\n\r\nIf someone has an Android device running on a newer Android version, it would be great if you can help me test this. No need to pull it down, just ping me and I can give you a URL that you can hit on your browser to run through the unit and manual tests.\r\n\r\n## TODO before merging\r\nThis is so I don\'t forget.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Update `event-flick` documentation\r\n* [ ] Push build files'

1309,'',"Improve event-move to have dual-listener support, better unit tests, better logic for handing options\nThis pull request improves the `event-move` module, and is the first step towards having better gesture events in YUI, as discussed in [this YUI-Contrib post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/yui-contrib/hwRCA2o5Ks8). \r\n\r\n## Background\r\nAs I mentioned in the [YUIContrib post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/yui-contrib/hwRCA2o5Ks8), it's important for YUI to have abstracted low-level start/move/end events. Originally, I was going to write these from scratch, but upon thinking about it more, this idea was already encapsulated within the `event-move` module. Unfortunately, it hadn't received some love in a while, so that's what I did here. No point creating new modules which duplicated the logic that was present in `event-move`. I just took what was in here and made it better.\r\n\r\nYes, there is the problem of someone not being able to subscribe to `gesturemove` if they don't subscribe to `gesturemovestart` as well, but this isn't really a problem because they can just set `standAlone: true`. In fact, maybe `standAlone` should be `true` by default. Not sure what you guys think about that. I didn't change that in this PR because it's a little outside the scope of it. \r\n\r\n## What's in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* `event-move` now has dual-listener support so that it works great in devices that support both mouse and touch\r\n* There was a long-standing bug in `event-move` regarding the `minTime` and `minDistance` options that could be passed into it. Since these options can be configured, there are actually 4 possible scenarios:\r\n  * `minTime = 0`, `minDistance = 0`\r\n  * `minTime > 0`, `minDistance = 0`\r\n  * `minTime = 0`, `minDistance > 0`\r\n  * `minTime > 0`, `minDistance > 0`\r\nThe old code did not have 4 separate paths for some reason. I branched the code to support all 4 use-cases.\r\n* Improved unit test coverage so that it's 90%+, and improved how the tests are written.\r\n* Created a more useful manual test page (`gestures.html`)\r\n\r\n## Test Coverage\r\nThis module has 90%+ test coverage. Some of the code is skipped on non-MSPointer environments, so test in IE10 for maximum coverage. Looking at the skipped lines though, they aren't areas which should give bugs. I can improve the coverage more if needed, but wanted to get the code out so it could be reviewed.\r\n\r\nI tested this code on:\r\n* IE7+\r\n* Latest Chrome\r\n* Latest FF\r\n* Latest Safari\r\n* Android 4.0.3\r\n* iOS7\r\n\r\n## Going Forward\r\n\r\nGoing forward, I want to improve the `event-flick` and add a few more gesture events to the library. We can use `event-move` as the de-facto low-level abstracted input event layer for YUI. \r\n\r\n## Todos Before Merging\r\n\r\nThis is just so that I don't forget.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Update docs for `event-move`\r\n* [ ] Commit build files\r\n"

1304,'clarle','Fixes cross-domain REST model.load() in older browsers via a simple (optional) config update\nUsing ModelSync.REST with IE 8 and 9 was failing when loading with cross-domain GET requests (i.e. the URL of the source data is in a separate domain from the current browser window). Unlike with Y.io(), there is currently no way to pass an XDR config to the underlying AJAX request to fix these errors.\r\n\r\nThis change simply allows a user to include an XDR object in the "options" parameter of model.load, which is passed through to the underlying Y.io() call. So the documentation for that option applies (i.e. { use: \'native\' }).\r\n\r\nIn IE 8 and 9, this enables the use of the XDomainRequest which supports XDR; additionally this eliminates the extra preflight OPTIONS request in modern CORS-compliant browsers since setting the XDR config object causes Y.io to remove the "X-Requested-With" header.'

1032,'',"Add 'provides' support to loader\nSummary of suggested change\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOften in YUI, there are reasons to blanket use a module - for example widget. Widget is a meta-module which depends on:\r\n* widget-base,\r\n* widget-htmlparser,\r\n* widget-skin,\r\n* widget-uievents\r\n\r\nWhilst some of the time, it wouldn't be prudent to use all of widget, people frequently do (in fact, anyone using overlay gets all of widget)\r\n\r\nAt present in these cases, when seeded with appropriate metadata, the loader is intelligent enough to know not to request widget (which is meta and doesn't exist on disk), but to request it's dependencies straight away. However, this means you end up with very long URLs in the request, which means that you reach the limit for URL length, and have to break your dependencies into multiple requests.\r\n\r\nIf you look at other dependency management systems (e.g. Debian packages), several of them have the notion of a 'Provides' field.\r\n\r\nAs an example of use in Debian, the window manager 'awesome' Provides 'x-window-manager'. In fact, all window managers Provide x-window-manager. As a result, anywhere which depends on x-window-manager will be satisfied by presence of any of the window managers presence.\r\n\r\nPutting this in to YUI parlance and extending it a little further, we could modify both the Loader, and Shifter to support a provides array such that:\r\n* for a module which provides other modules, Shifter rolls up those modules automatically and creates a module in the build directory; and\r\n* the Loader knows only to request the main module rather than all of its' dependencies.\r\n\r\nPossible pitfalls\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis *could* lead to an increase in size of the delivered content if widget-base is requested initially, and then later the whole of widget is requested. In these cases, the browser cache would hopefully be filled after the first set of calls, but we could also have the loader output a warning message (in debug mode obviously) to inform developers that they have suboptimal dependencies. We could also attempt to just fill the missing modules to reduce over-the-wire transfer in these cases.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this could get complicated - where modules depend on plugins outside of the standard remit, we would have to take care not to include these. As an example, half of attribute depend on oop. It wouldn't make sense to include oop in with attribute as it's widely used by other modules.\r\n\r\n\r\nA real-world example\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs an example from the CDN, to load widget, two requests are made loading a total of 28 modules:\r\n\r\n* http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?3.10.1/oop/oop-min.js&3.10.1/attribute-core/attribute-core-min.js&3.10.1/event-custom-base/event-custom-base-min.js&3.10.1/event-custom-complex/event-custom-complex-min.js&3.10.1/attribute-observable/attribute-observable-min.js&3.10.1/attribute-extras/attribute-extras-min.js&3.10.1/attribute-base/attribute-base-min.js&3.10.1/attribute-complex/attribute-complex-min.js&3.10.1/base-core/base-core-min.js&3.10.1/base-observable/base-observable-min.js&3.10.1/base-base/base-base-min.js&3.10.1/pluginhost-base/pluginhost-base-min.js&3.10.1/pluginhost-config/pluginhost-config-min.js&3.10.1/base-pluginhost/base-pluginhost-min.js&3.10.1/classnamemanager/classnamemanager-min.js&3.10.1/dom-core/dom-core-min.js&3.10.1/dom-base/dom-base-min.js&3.10.1/selector-native/selector-native-min.js&3.10.1/selector/selector-min.js&3.10.1/node-core/node-core-min.js&3.10.1/node-base/node-base-min.js&3.10.1/event-base/event-base-min.js&3.10.1/event-synthetic/event-synthetic-min.js\r\n* http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?3.10.1/event-focus/event-focus-min.js&3.10.1/dom-style/dom-style-min.js&3.10.1/node-style/node-style-min.js&3.10.1/widget-base/widget-base-min.js&3.10.1/widget-htmlparser/widget-htmlparser-min.js&3.10.1/widget-skin/widget-skin-min.js&3.10.1/event-delegate/event-delegate-min.js&3.10.1/node-event-delegate/node-event-delegate-min.js&3.10.1/widget-uievents/widget-uievents-min.js\r\n\r\nThese have lengths of 996, and 408 characters respectively.\r\n\r\nSome of these could easily be broken down so that a request for the module only uses one file, and provides all of the rest.

957,'ekashida',"If a `use` statement results in both css and js downloads, they should happen in parallel\n[Original ticket](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2532902)\r\n\r\nSummary of the original email thread by @sdesai for clarity:\r\n\r\na) As of 3.5.0 a Y.Get.css() call blocks a subsequent Y.Get.js() call, until the css call is done. This is by design.\r\nb) As of 3.5.0, a Y.Get.js() call blocks a subsequent Y.Get.js() call, until the first js call is done. This is by design.\r\n\r\nI believe both of these changes in behavior were introduced consciously in 3.5.0, to provide the safest behavior out of the box by default. Prior to 3.5.0 one Y.Get.script() or Y.Get.link() call wouldn't block another AFAIK (need to confirm).\r\n\r\nLoader/use makes the calls to Y.Get.css(), Y.Get.js() sequentially, and doesn't manually force the second (JS) transaction to execute in parallel.\r\n\r\nTwo ways to address this - assuming we want the 3.4.1 behavior back for use(), where CSS is loaded independently of JS:\r\n\r\n1) In loader/use, force the 2nd (JS) transaction to execute in parallel with the first (CSS) transaction.\r\n2) Revert Y.Get to the non-blocking 3.4.1 behavior (need to confirm) as far as separate Y.Get.js() or Y.Get.css() calls go.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that we should consider 2) for the following reasons:\r\ni) Y.Get is a fundamentally async API, and from the API standpoint it's unexpected for the following calls to block each other. They're unrelated calls:\r\n```\r\nY.Get.css(url, callback);\r\n...\r\nY.Get.js(url, callback);\r\n...\r\nY.Get.js(url, callback);\r\n```\r\nii) Applying i) to the use-case standpoint, the current behavior means that 2 completely unrelated pieces of code/modules making Y.Get.js() calls, block each other by default. So, for example, a\r\nstandalone Pictures module and a standalone Locations module end up blocking each other, when making 2 completely independent YQL calls - resulting in poor performance, for the default mode. On the flip side if scripts do have dependencies that need to be serialized when pulled in dynamically, that piece of knowledge is contained with a single piece of code/module and it's trivial for that module to group them in a transaction (which is serialized by default):\r\n`Y.Get.js([scriptOne, scriptTwo]);`\r\nThe API already provides a trivial and clean way to handle related scripts.\r\niii) There was a regression in API behavior going from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0 - from non-blocking to blocking (again, assuming that's true - need to confirm).\r\n\r\nIf we can get agreement on 2) being the right way to approach this, feel free to re-assign to Get."

The new logic checks the target _specifically_ to see if it is a disabled element and aborts the filtering loop.\r\n\r\nI think the subscriber shouldn't be fired when a button's child element is clicked because\r\nit complicates the use case of event handling for disabled elements, making it necessary for developers to both understand and handle the case where e.g. clicking on part of a button will fire an event, but on another part, there is no event."

They can be loaded separately depending on the kind of cell editors needed.  They don't collide with each other so they can also be loaded together, though it would look weird to the user.  Either of them will load `datatable-editable`.\r\n\r\nThese modules rely on a bunch of other PRs, few are merged yet..\r\n* `Y.Number.parse` and `Y.Date.parse` are needed so the values formatted into the cell editor can be parsed back.\r\n* `datatable-scroll` so the cell editor can respond to the table scrolling by repositioning itself or hide when out of the window.\r\n* `datatable-keynav` for keyboard navigation within the datatable and not just mouse clicking.\r\n* `datatable-formatter` for cell formatting.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests are as yet quite minimal.  Anyway, my intention was to start the discussion about this new module.  Something of this complexity needs plenty of time for discussing so we might as well start right away.  \r\n\r\nNote that the other PRs listed above are independent and useful on their own, it would be great to have them merged in advance.  \r\n"

Looks like eventTarget is a clone inside defaultFunc?\r\n\r\nIt would be very handy if it were the same object that is passed to the afterdescriber. Let me explain with my use-case:\r\n\r\nI created a viewclass, that has specific buttons: 'submit', 'save' etc. Once clicked, I made the attached model to fire these events: 'model:submitclick', 'model:saveclick' etc. The defaultFn handles the real action, you might think of model.save() and model.submit().\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not use model.save(), but my own created model.savePromise() which calls the sync-layer and returns a promise.\r\n\r\nNow: the user can listen for 'model:saveclick' -which could be defaultprevented- which will store the data inside defaultFn by calling model.savePromise. But how does the user get the promisehandle? I would like to at this at the eventTarget: e.promise = model.savePromise(). This all works fine, except that eventTarget is augmented inside defaultFn. e.promise seems not available in the aftersubscriber.\r\n\r\nMarco."

639,'ezequiel','[Loader] Sorting modules incorrectly when YUI.GlobalConfig.groups is configurated\nWhen we upgrade our site from 3.5.1 to 3.8.0, a strange error occurs again and again. The code is very simple:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar nlAddCart = Y.all(\'.add-cart\');\r\nnlAddCart.on(\'click\', function (e) {\r\n    e.halt();\r\n    // do sth\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThere are two items in `nlAddCart`, but neither acts as we wish when a click event happens.\r\n\r\nI spend one day to find out the reason, and finally get it:\r\n\r\nStep 1: `YUI.GlobalConfig` is initialized with a object `o`, which has a `groups` property to contain all our modules:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.GlobalConfig = {\r\n    // ...\r\n    groups: {\r\n        fecore: {\r\n            \'mt-base\': {\r\n                requires: [\'yui\', \'node-base\'],\r\n                path: //...\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 2: when a new YUI instance `Y` is created, `o.groups` is mixed to `Y.config`\r\n\r\nStep 3: when `Y.use` is called for the first time, a new `Y.Loader` instance, named `loader`, is created with `Y.config`. `loader._config` is automatically called in the construction process,  and then `loader.addGroup`, and then `loader.addModule`,\r\n```javascript\r\n// https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.8.0/build/yui/yui.js#L6653\r\nthis.moduleInfo[name] = o;\r\n```\r\nall module meta on `YUI.GlobalConfig.groups` is assigned to `loader.moduleInfo`.\r\n\r\nStep 4: in the `loader._explode` method (explode all modules directly or indirectly required by used modules, it is called by `loader.calculate` in `Y.use`), an important method `loader.getRequires` is called to collect all modules directly or indirectly required by current module, and assign this collection result to the module\'s property `expanded/expanded_map`. Therefore, the meta in `YUI.GlobalConfig` is changed globally. To optimize performance, `loader.getRequires` detects some features to avoid needless computing: \r\n```javascript\r\n// https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.8.0/build/yui/yui.js#L7012\r\nreparse = !((!this.lang || mod.langCache === this.lang) && (mod.skinCache === this.skin.defaultSkin));\r\n\r\nif (mod.expanded && !reparse) {\r\n    return mod.expanded;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 5: in the `loader._sort` method called after `loader._explode`, a comparison method `loader._require(mod1, mod2)` is called for each pair of modules to determine which should be put ahead. The `expanded/expanded_map` property of a module plays a big role.\r\n\r\nStep 6: in the first `YUI.use(\'mt-base\')` statement, all modules required by \'mt-base\' are processed by `loader.getRequire` method and consequently gets the `expanded/expanded_map` property. But when `YUI.use(\'mt-base\')` runs in the second time, as \'mt-base\' already has `expanded`, `skinCache`, and `langCache` properties, `loader.getRequire` returns `expanded` result directly according to Step 4. Therefore, every YUI built-in modules required by \'mt-base\' havs no `expanded` property, finally, `loader._sort` method computes a wrong sequence. In this example, the order is:\r\n```javascript\r\n["yui", "node-base", "event-base", "event-custom-base", "oop", "yui-base", "node-core", "dom-core", "features", "selector", "selector-native", "dom-base", "mt-base"]\r\n```\r\nThis causes `Y._attach` process \'event-base\' before \'dom-core\' and \'dom-base\', and further results in `shouldIterate` method gets a wrong answer. So, `nlAddCart.on` fails.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this problem is caused by two points:\r\n- meta info on `YUI.GlobalConfig` is used and modified by `loader.getRequires`\r\n- the optimization of `loader.getRequires` results in some YUI builtin modules missing `expanded/expanded_map` property, and finally causes `loader._sort` gives a wrong module sequence.\r\n\r\nThe full code:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.GlobalConfig = {\r\n    root: \'...\',\r\n    combine: true,\r\n    comboBase: \'...\',\r\n    groups: {\r\n        fecore: {\r\n            \'mt-base\': {\r\n                requires: [\'yui\', \'node-base\'],\r\n                path: \'...\'\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nYUI().use(\'mt-base\', function (Y) {\r\n    // do sth\r\n});\r\nYUI().use(\'mt-base\', function (Y) {\r\n    var nlAddCart = Y.all(\'.add-cart\');\r\n    nlAddCart.on(\'click\', function (e) {\r\n        e.halt();\r\n        // do sth\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

Once they catch such an event: they need to look up in the domstructure whether the node that fired the node:destroy-event is a parentNode of the Node it was bound to itself.

The cleanup should exists of cleaning the Node._instances with all references of the destoyed Node, as well as its children. Because this has a performancehit, 'memorySafe' should be made an option.

561,'rgrove',"Addition of convenience methods to ModelList for get and set Model-attributes\nWhen using a widget where the end-developer (who uses someone elses widget), can attach bot a ModelList- or LazyModelList-instance (as an attribute), it is hard to read the properties of an item.\r\n\r\nInside the widget, the widget-developer must deal with the fact that both Model.get('someattribute') must be called, while in other situations, Model.somettribute.\r\n\r\nAs an example: I asked for a featurerequest where we can fill Y.DataTable with both Y.ModelList as well as Y.LazyModelList (for the data-attribute). But now, Y.DataTable will suffer an internal problem when it comes down to read/writing the data.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Y.ModelList would have come with these 3 methods:\r\n```\r\nY.ModelList.getModelAttr: function(model, name);\r\nY.ModelList.setModelAttr: function(model, name, value, options);\r\nY.ModelList.getModelToJSON : function(model);\r\n```\r\nthen the Y.DataTable-class could use these methods without having to worry whether an Y.ModelList or Y.LazyModelList is being used.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I've got this need with a lot of extentions I create. A huge number of current widgets can be filled with data through the HTML_PARSER. An extention that can pass data through either Y.ModelList or Y.LazyModelList is very useful here.

Me would be the "me" passed to the configFn function\r\n    \t\t    },\r\n\r\n                                   }\r\n                       }\r\n                 }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also noticed that yui\'s core modules will never use any of the patterns. Is there anyway to force them to do so?\r\n\r\nFinally, if the above is available, how should I define my modules?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nYUI.applyConfig({\r\n    comboBase: "/assets/js?",\r\n    combine: true,\r\n    groups:{\r\n    \tcss:{\r\n    \t    comboBase: "/assets/css?",\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t    patterns:{\r\n    \t\tcss:{\r\n    \t\t    test: function(name, me) {\r\n    \t\t       //do some testing here. Me would be the "me" passed to the configFn function\r\n    \t\t    },\r\n\r\n                                   }\r\n                       }\r\n                 }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n     "modules": {\r\n                "my-module": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node", "loader"],\r\n                    "path": "my-module/my-module-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above, will the loader first use the patterns to determine the comboBase and then use the module definitions below (but not inside any groups) to determine the dependencies and path?'
524,'ezequiel','Issues with loader\'s combine and comboBase\nI have a very simple config like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.applyConfig({\r\n    "comboBase": "/assets/js?",\r\n    "root": "yui-3.9.0/",\r\n    "groups": {\r\n        "template": {\r\n            "root": "template/",\r\n            "modules": {\r\n                "some-module": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module/some-module-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n                "some-module2": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module2/some-module2-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe documentation states that `combine` should be `true` by default.\r\n\r\nSo, if I run this code (http://jsfiddle.net/KVBHW/):\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.Env.Sandbox = YUI().use(\'selector-css3\', \'some-module\', \'some-module2\', function (Y) {\t\r\n   \r\n});\r\n```\r\nI would expect that my modules are combined.

From my understanding of the docs, when we set a `comboBase`, in the root of the config, all other groups should use it, unless they have overridden it. \r\n\r\nHowever, if `combine` is explicitly set to `true` within a group it uses the correct combo base and combines the files (http://jsfiddle.net/GbpJu/):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.applyConfig({\r\n    "comboBase": "/assets/js?",\r\n    "root": "yui-3.9.0/",\r\n    "groups": {\r\n        "template": {\r\n            "combine": true,\r\n            "root": "template/",\r\n            "modules": {\r\n                "some-module": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module/some-module-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n                "some-module2": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module2/some-module2-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2263040/279254/067dadba-9117-11e2-8ca7-5d7276ecbdb9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n'

If the event is prevented, the instance can *never* be destroyed.  It's a valid use case to want to prevent destruction at certain moments, but this is misleading.  I would assume that if destruction was prevented, it would still be able to occur sometime later.

465,'',"automate dependency configuration\nNowadays, YUI3 has lots of modules, and the same as our project. A problem is becoming more and more obvious: configuration of module dependencies is very annoying, some times missing some modules, sometimes overloading some modules, and the latter occurs frequently.\r\n\r\nSo, why not let machine do this complicated job?\r\n\r\nOur team is now trying to automate dependency configuration. The simple idea is to build a API-module map, so that a new module dependency can be determined through parsing code and API calculation. But we find out that, some YUI modules don't expose APIs, instead, they just mix some properties to prototype, like node-event-delegate. In such situation, manual intervention is necessary.\r\n\r\nMaybe there are other better ways to automate dependency configuration, any idea is appreciated.\r\n\r\nDo YUI team has any plan to automate dependency configuration? Can you help us make the API-module map more accurate?"
446,'','Y.Attribute needs to support alias attribute names\n`Y.Model` has a lovely feature for supporting aliases for its `id` attribute, which enables the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nY.MyModel = Y.Base.create(\'myModel\', Y.Model, [], {\r\n    idAttribute: \'uid\'\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar model = new Y.Model({uid: 1});\r\nY.log(model.get(\'uid\')); // => 1\r\nY.log(model.get(\'id\'));  // => 1\r\n\r\nvar data = model.toJSON();\r\nY.log(data.id);  // => undefined\r\nY.log(data.uid); // => 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows other code working with models to always assume it can access the model\'s id via its `id` attribute, even if the specific model subclass actually uses a different attribute for its "real" id. `Y.Model` is also smart about data serialization; and if the model subclass defines an `idAttribute`, `Y.Model` will make sure *that* attribute value is represented while discarding the default `id` attribute alias.\r\n\r\n### Issues with Model\'s Approach to Aliases\r\n\r\nSimply put, `Y.Model`\'s `id` attribute alias feature is a *hack*, and breaks down in several ways:\r\n\r\n* Uses *two* attributes, each with their own `ATTRS` configs.\r\n* Two attributes means two event fire cycles (plus the coalesced `change` event.)\r\n* Unclear how defining validators and setters should work between the alias attributes (which is the truth?)\r\n* Overrides main `Y.Attribute` methods.\r\n* Hard to optimize for performance.\r\n\r\n### Alias Support in Attribute\r\n\r\nA better place to implement the attribute alias feature is in `Y.Attribute`, it could even be a class extension if there would be a performance hit. This would alleviate `Y.Model` from having to *hack-in* this feature, and open it up to other components which use attributes.\r\n\r\nTo optimize the event performance, `Y.EventTarget` may also need to change to accommodate aliases; this is still TDB.'

436,'','Make App\'s `showView()` more consistent when working with new vs. existing views.\nApp\'s `showView()` method can take a view _name_ or an existing view _instance_. A problem arises with ad-hoc attributes in the following scenario:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar view = new Y.View();\r\nY.log(view.template); // => ""\r\n\r\napp.showView(view, {template: \'bla bla\'}, {update: true}, function (view) {\r\n    Y.log(view.template);        // => ""\r\n    Y.log(view.get(\'template\')); // => "bla bla"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen passing an existing view instance with the `update` option set, the `showView()` method will call `setAttrs()` on the view instance with anything in the `config` argument. This means that a `template` attribute is created.\r\n\r\nCompare the above with calling `showView()` using a named view:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\napp.showView(\'someView\', {template: \'bla bla\'}, function (view) {\r\n    Y.log(view.template);        // => "bla bla"\r\n    Y.log(view.get(\'template\')); // => undefined\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe problem is that non-ad-hoc attributes specified in a view class\' [`_NON_ATTRS_CFG` property](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/api/files/app_js_view.js.html#l413) only apply at construction time.\r\n\r\nSome possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Simply document this as an expected difference in behavior when working with existing vs. new views.\r\n\r\n2. "Filter" out properties which match items in `_NON_ATTRS_CFG` when `showView()` is updating an existing view.\r\n\r\n3. Apply the above filtering, but _also_ assign the filtered properties as new values to properties on the existing view instance.\r\n\r\n4. Remove `showView()`\'s `update` option, and let people who are managing their own view life cycles, also manage updating their view\'s properties and attributes.\r\n\r\nI don\'t see a great solution above to address this. I\'m open to hear other ones and/or which of the above you like best.'
