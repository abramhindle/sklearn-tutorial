The example I put together on the Chromium bug tracker used only native history controls, but I wanted to show an example of how you can run into the same thing when using YUI. I created a Gist (https://gist.github.com/roblund/6430494) containing a simple page. You should be able to reproduce the issue by using the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Save the Gist to a file (start up something like a python simplehttpserver to serve the page)\r\n2. Load the test page in Chrome\r\n3. On the first load, we will drop into the 'if' and run HistoryHTML5.add() which should append our query string to the URL and add our history state to the stack.\r\n4. Click 'some link' and go to the test2 page (which is just blank page with no JS)\r\n5. Click Back in the browser\r\n6. Verify you are sent back to test.html.\r\n7. Click 'some link' again and go to the test2 page.\r\n8. Click Back in the browser\r\n9. You will be sent to test3.html which is the href in your base tag.\r\n\r\nYUI is calling replaceState when the page is loaded after clicking back and a 'null' is sent in as the third parameter, which corresponds to URL. You can see this on line 107 of https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/history/js/history-html5.js. Chrome/Webkit is then incorrectly then taking the href from the base tag and adding that to the history stack instead of using the current url (which is what Firefox and Internet Explorer do).\r\n\r\nThe reason this is relevant to YUI is that I believe you could potentially workaround this bug in Chrome/Webkit by changing the 'null' on line 107 of https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/history/js/history-html5.js to instead be 'document.URL'. In my limited testing this seems to avoid the Chrome/Webkit issue completely, because you are explicitly setting the url that is sent into replaceState.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything that doesn't make sense, please let me know and I'll be happy to clarify."

But the tests for this change were not run in IE < 9, and when they are [subtle differences are surfaced in how old IEs vs. modern browsers deal with NPCG when calling the regex\'s `exec()` method](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/npcg-javascript). The following example illustrates the issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar route = /\\/foo\\/(bar)?/;\r\n\r\n// In modern browsers:\r\nconsole.log(route.exec(\'/foo/\')); // => ["/foo/", undefined]\r\n\r\n// In IE < 9:\r\nconsole.log(route.exec(\'/foo/\')); // => ["/foo/", ""]\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn the context of route dispatching in Router, the result of `exec()`-ing the regex route path is assigned to `req.params`. Since request parameters are dealing with strings, I think a fine compromise is to always make sure they are an array of strings and coerce `undefined` to empty string, both are falsy values.'

It would also be useful if Router accepted an already processed route config object provided by the caller.\r\n\r\nTo coordinate routes between the server (like Express) and client, it's important to make sure subtle things like whether to use optional trailing slashes are preserved. The best way to do this is to provide `Y.Router` with the same regex path that's used server side. The problem in doing so is when a regex path is used, you have to use unnamed params in route handlers. Allowing the following would resolve this issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar routeConfigFromServer = {\r\n    path  : '/posts/:postId',\r\n    keys  : ['postId'],\r\n    regexp: /^\\/posts\\/(?:([^\\/]+?))\\/?$/i\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar router = new Y.Router();\r\n\r\nrouter.showPost = function (req, res, next) {\r\n    // ...\r\n};\r\n\r\nrouter.route(routeConfigFromServer, 'showPost');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow `keys` to be supplied with the `regexp`, giving the route handlers named params."
1063,'ericf','Add support for mapping route params to regexps or functions for processing\nIt\'s desirable to both use string-based routes with named params, e.g., `"/posts/:id"`, and assign some processing to route param values, e.g., `id` should be a number.\r\n\r\nThis adds a feature to Router to support mapping named params to regular expressions or functions. See the following example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar router = new Y.Router({\r\n    params: {\r\n        id      : Number,\r\n        username: /^\\w+$/\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.route(\'/posts/:id\', function (req) {\r\n    // This route will only be executed when `id` is a number.\r\n    // `req.params.id` is number resulting from passing the string value\r\n    // to the `Number()` constructor.\r\n    Y.log(\'Show post: \' req.params.id);\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.route(\'/users/:username\', function (req) {\r\n    // This route will only be executed when `id` is a number.\r\n    // `req.params.username` is the result object/captures array from\r\n    // `exec()`-ing the regular expression.\r\n    Y.log(\'Show user:\' req.params.username[0]);\r\n});\r\n\r\nrouter.save(\'/posts/1\');     // => "Show post: 1"\r\nrouter.save(\'/users/ericf\'); // => "Show user: ericf"\r\n\r\n// This won\'t log anything because `id` is not a number, the route is skipped.\r\nrouter.save(\'/posts/asdf\');\r\n\r\n// This won\'t log anything because `username` is not alpha-number, the route \r\n// is skipped.\r\nrouter.save(\'/users/eric,ryan\');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nThe main goal for this feature is to enable people to stick with string-based route paths and named `req.params` while adding support for basic param processing/validation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when people want to process request parameter values, they either have to add a route callback function, or switch to using regex route paths. Adding another callback/middleware isn\'t the end of world, but it gets repetitive since it has to be added to every route (or to a common middleware stack). Having to switch to using regex route paths sucks because you lose named request parameters, and those route paths are hard for humans to parse.\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n- [x] Write initial implementation\r\n- [x] Add support for functions\r\n- [x] Write tests which fully cover feature\r\n- [x] Test in all YUI Target Environments\r\n- [x] Fill out API docs\r\n- [x] Update user guide\r\n- [x] Add HISTORY.md entry\r\n'

1051,'apipkin','Fix #1041 - YUI Editor should be able to work without iframe\nThis PR introduces a new feature in YUI Editor - it will be able to work in two modes now:\r\n1. Using iframe (the old approach)\r\n2. As an inline (so called "HTML5") editor\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, the architecture of the Editor has been changed a bit. It now has two containers - the old one iframe and a new one, called "Content Editable".\r\nBoth are plugins and extend Plugin.Base.\r\n\r\nFollowing and old conversation with @davglass, and to achieve backward compatibility, if there is no container specified, EditorBase will load the old iframe.\r\n\r\nHere is an example how YUI Editor could be transformed to an inline editor:\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n    var myEditor = new Y.EditorBase({\r\n        content: \'<p>Hello world. I\\\'m an inline editor. No iframe here!</p>\',\r\n        plugins: [\r\n            Y.Plugin.ContentEditable\r\n        ]\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    myEditor.render(\'#editor\');\r\n````\r\n\r\nAs you see, the only difference is that we plug a plugin - Y.Plugin.ContentEditable. If we don\'t plug it, we will have an editor with an iframe.\r\n\r\nThere are no API changes, so people should have 100% backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nTo prove that, let\'s use a Toolbar from YUI Gallery, for example [Itsa EditorToolbar](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/itsatoolbar) by @ItsAsbreuk:\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n     var myEditor = new Y.EditorBase({\r\n        content: \'<p>Hello world. I\\\'m an inline editor. No iframe here!</p>\',\r\n        plugins: [\r\n            Y.Plugin.ContentEditable,\r\n            {\r\n                fn: Y.Plugin.ITSAToolbar,\r\n                cfg: {\r\n                    srcNode: \'#toolbar\'\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    myEditor.render(\'#editor\');\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe toolbar works flawlessly directly loaded from Yahoo!

First, toJSON is called on the model. This does not include clientId per Y.Model\'s documentation. Then the values object is created including an explicit clientId.

681,'apipkin',"[DT] Added isHidden method to determine if a cell or row is visible\nFor the cell editor, I had to hide the editor when the cell being edited is scrolled away.  The code to determine if the cell is still visible relies too heavily in the particulars of the way scrolling is implemented so it could not reasonably remain with the cell editor with such a strong dependency.\r\n\r\nThe only public method that `datatable-scrollable` currently offers is `scrollTo`.  I added `isHidden` to determine if the cell or row is visible or not.\r\n\r\nTo do so I broke apart the part of the code from `scrollTo` that locates the element to be scrolled to and put it in a shared `_locateTarget` method.\r\n\r\n`isHidden` takes the same argument as `scrollTo` plus a `partially` flag to allow to ask whether the element is totally hidden (the default) or just partially covered.\r\n\r\nI am not sure about the names.  Should I provide `isHidden` or `isVisible` ?  Perhaps it should be `isElementHidden` (it handles cells and rows so how could I refer to either?).  Also, `_locateTarget` got that name because the local variable in `scrollTo` was called `target` but I can't claim the name is a good one.  Suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nWhile adding tests I noticed that  `_locateTarget` could not locate a row by the `clientId` of the model it represents as the API docs claims so I added that.\r\n\r\nI am also unsure of whether to provide that `partially` argument to `isHidden` is the right thing to do or if it would be better to provide different returns, for example, false or 0 for not hidden, true or 2 for totally hidden and 1 for partially hidden (which also evaluates to true if you are not particularly concerned). Or 0, 1 and -1.\r\n\r\nI also found that `scrollTo` doesn't really scroll fully into view a cell beyond the right edge when there is a vertical scroll bar.  `scrollIntoView` ignores that the vertical scroll bar is there so the cell gets at least partially hidden behind it.  It makes `isHidden` fail because on all of the other edges, if you scroll to a cell, it gets completely visible while in this case, it gets at most partially visible.\r\n\r\nI wonder if providing a `region` (like `node.get('region')`) would be a good idea."

Merge A and B\'s ATTRS, to capture overrides (B sets a new default value for example).\r\n\r\n2. Loop around all classes:\r\n\r\n     2a. Add A\'s ATTRS from merged ATTRS\r\n     2b. Call A\'s initializer\r\n     2c. Add B\'s ATTRS from merged ATTRS\r\n     2d. Call B\'s initializer\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the funky edge case, where if B overrides the setter of one of A\'s ATTRS, and in the setter refers to one of it\'s own attributes, they won\'t be set up when the setter is invoked, leading to: https://github.com/yui/yui3/pull/626\r\n\r\nWith this ticket, we would be changing it to:\r\n\r\n1.

The root cause of this phenomenon is because \'run\' always gets the next callback, thus always evaluate the \'until\' function of the next callback. But \'run\' doesn\'t need to get the next callback at all when the current callback execution says not to continue running the queue (for exemple when \'pause\' or \'stop\' has been called).\r\n\r\n3. when pause() and run() are called "synchronously" by a callback execution, the run() call doesn\'t do what we expect (= resume) but triggers an extra execution of the callback. This can be fixed by keeping a reference somewhere to know if we are inside a callback execution, so that the run method behaves adequately (c399b92), fixes issues [#2528602](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2528602) / [#2531758](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2531758) / [#2531844](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2531844)\r\n\r\nShould I file separate bug reports on http://yuilibrary.com/ for the first 2 issues that have not been reported previously ?

If it is passed to the setter or validator,\nthey can decide whether to accept or not a value.\n\nIt is like using _set for changes to read-only attributes,\nusing _set instead of set allows you to override the read-only.\nIn this case, passing the options argument to setter and \nvalidator, allows you a conditional setting based\nin the value and the origin of it.\n\nFor example, the setter on an attribute might accept\nand parse a string containing numbers when the source\nis the UI because input boxes only return strings.\nThe same setter might reject values set from unspecified\nsources if they are not real numeric.  Likewise,\nit might accept 0 for false and 1 for true when the source\nis a remote database while accepting only Booleans from\nother sources.  When setting a date, the extra argument\nmight indicate the format the date string is in.\n\nI have added those opts to both the setter and the validator\nso they can decide on accepting or rejecting the value\nbased on the origin of the data.\n\nI wonder if I should add the option to allow the third argument\nto set to be a string and, in that case, make an object with the\n"src" property set to that value.  Thus, these two would be the same:\n\no.set("attrA", true, "UI");\no.set("attrA", true, {src:"UI"}); \n\n------------------------------------\nProvided an extra test to try the setter with the extra argument\nThis change should be fully backward compatible.\nChanged the landing page.\n\nInadvertently I stripped trailing spaces on the changed sources,\nwhich JSHint complained about anyway.

Trac ticket [#2532745](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2532745/)\n\nScrollView's Paginator plugin previously respected a `minVelocity` value to trigger a page change, but this was left out of the 3.7.0 cleanup as a preference for more simple code.  However, it was discussed that this should probably be reintroduced.  \n\nAlso left out was a drag distance threshold as a minimum for page change.  So for example, on a 500px widget, previously the distance dragged would need to be >=250px to trigger a page change, otherwise it would snap back.  But in 3.7.0 this could be triggered with just a 1px drag.  Arguments can be made for either behavior, and it should probably be a configurable value, but to respect backwards compatibility until it can be researched further, it has been reintroduced.\n\nThese two related updates are primarily confined to two methods inside `paginator-plugin.js`\n\n  * `_beforeHostFlick` - Reacts to the flick behavior, which is now responsible for handling pagination instead of deferring to the drag listener.  Additional logic has been added to determine ability to scroll on the paginator's axis, as well as determining pagination direction.  This method will prevent ScrollView's `flick` listener from firing, since the post-drag action is already determined (a page).\n  * `_afterHostGestureMoveEnd` - Reacts to drag events.  Additional logic added to determine the distance of the drag, and compare that to the halfway point of the page node's width/height.\n\nWhen reintroducing code/logic, it can sometimes be helpful to compare old vs new.  They are not directly comparable because different `on`/`after` calls, as well as the host methods doing slightly different things as well. But for the curious:\n\n3.6.0 [_flickFrame](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.6.0/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L181)\n3.7.0 [_beforeHostFlick](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L340)\n\n3.6.0 [_onGestureMoveEnd](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.6.0/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L167)\n3.7.0 [_afterHostGestureMoveEnd](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L261)\n\nA few additional notes\n  * In the more aggressive flick testing for this update, an unrelated issue was discovered where the widget's `_maxScroll{X/Y}` values could be reset to zero, subsequently preventing normal interaction with ScrollView.  This was due to some logic specifically for dual-axis instances but was not wrapped in a check to ensure it was dual-axis.  Fixed, [line #426](https://github.com/derek/yui3/blob/sv_flick_page/src/scrollview/js/paginator-plugin.js#L426).\n  * To provide maximum time for review before code freeze, full testing will be done in parallel to code review. It has been tested so far in Firefox, Chrome, and iOS, and a full test will be completed before merge.\n"

230,'ericf','Y.Template and Y.Template.Micro - Generic template API and simple ERB/Underscore-style JavaScript templates\nWhile working on a new widget recently, I found myself wanting a string-based templating solution that was more advanced than `Y.Lang.sub()` or `Y.substitute()`, but without the overhead of `Y.Handlebars`. I needed support for interpolation, if/else branching, and looping, but only for a few very small templates. Underscore-style templates (more familiar as ERB-style templates to Rubyists) seemed like exactly the right fit.\r\n\r\nThese commits add a new `Y.Template` class which provides a generic template engine API, and a `Y.Template.Micro` static class which provides a simple micro-templating engine. `Y.Template` can be used to compile, precompile, render, and revive precompiled templates using Handlebars or `Y.Template.Micro`.\r\n\r\n### Y.Template\r\n\r\nUsing with `Y.Template.Micro` (the default template engine):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template\', function (Y) {\r\n    var micro = new Y.Template(),\r\n        html  = micro.render(\'<%= data.message %>\', {message: \'hello!\'});\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing with Handlebars:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template-base\', \'handlebars\', function (Y) {\r\n    var handlebars = new Y.Template(Y.Handlebars),\r\n        html       = handlebars.render(\'{{message}}\', {message: \'hello!\'});\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the API docs for further details.\r\n\r\n### Y.Template.Micro\r\n\r\nProvides simple ERB/Underscore-style micro-templating. Can be used standalone or via `Y.Template`.\r\n\r\nWithin a template, `<% ... %>` is used to insert a block of JavaScript code, `<%= ... %>` evaluates and prints an expression as HTML-escaped output, and `<%== ... %>` evaluates and prints an expression as raw, unescaped output. Properties on the data object passed to a template function are made available within the template on the `data` variable.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a simple template that renders a list:\r\n\r\n```rhtml\r\n<ul class="<%= data.classNames.list %>">\r\n    <% Y.Array.each(data.items, function (item) { %>\r\n        <li><%= item %></li>\r\n    <% }); %>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here\'s the code to compile the template and render it (assume `listTemplate` is a string containing the template above):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nYUI().use(\'template-micro\', function (Y) {\r\n    var compiled = Y.Template.Micro.compile(listTemplate),\r\n        html;\r\n\r\n    // Render the compiled template to HTML.\r\n    html = compiled({\r\n        classNames: {list: \'yui3-list\'},\r\n        items     : [\'one\', \'two\', \'three\', \'four\']\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // And again, with a different set of data.\r\n    html = compiled({\r\n        classNames: {list: \'yui3-list\'},\r\n        items     : [\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\']\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrecompilation is supported too, so Micro can be used to precompile templates at build time or on the server.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// `precompile()` returns a string containing JavaScript code that will evaluate\r\n// to a template function. It can be written to a file, served to a remote\r\n// client, etc.\r\nvar source = Y.Template.Micro.precompile(listTemplate);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n`Y.Template.Micro` is significantly faster than both Underscore and Handlebars at both compiling and rendering templates. See http://jsperf.com/y-template-vs-others/6\r\n\r\n### Running Locally\r\n\r\nThe built `template`, `handlebars`, and `yui` modules are intentionally not included in this pull request in order to keep the diffs clean.

Later on, when calendar supports __round__ or\r\n__round-dark__, there would be no changes needed to the code below.\r\n\r\n    YUI({\r\n        skin: {\r\n            order: 'round,round-dark,night,sam-dark'\r\n        }\r\n    }).use('test', 'calendar', 'slider-base', function (Y) {...});\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `skins.order` property is backwards compatible which means\r\nthat changing the `defaultSkin` and using `overrides` still works as expected.\r\n\r\nMetadata for skins (see MOD_SKINS in Loader.js 46-75) generated by [comp_skins](https://github.com/ryanvanoss/comp_skins) and could be added to build files (a la requires metadata).\r\n\r\nYou can play with skin order and overrides here: http://23.21.81.23/yui3configurator/index.php, and run the existing unit tests, along with the additional tests from this pull request, here: http://23.21.81.23/yui/tests/loader/tests/index.html.\r\n\r\nConfigurator source code available here: https://github.com/ryanvanoss/yui3configurator\r\n"

98,'rgrove',"Added hasNext property to req.\nThis provides a way for route callback functions to determine if there are any matching routes after this one.\r\n\r\nAn issue came up in an app with many routes.  About half of the routes require a user to be logged in.  Instead of putting the log in check within each route, it would be far more convenient to put the log in check in one route before all the others then call next() once it has been confirmed that the user is actually logged in.\r\n\r\nCurrently the best solution for this scenario is to create a route with a regex path that matches every possible path that requires user log in.  As the app grows, that regex could become quite unwieldy.  The next best option is to use wild card routes, but there is a drawback to using wild card routes for this purpose.  If the '*' route forces a user to log in, but there happens to be a typo in the path, the call to next() won't do anything.  So they logged in for nothing.  If the app is set up to display a 404 message, a user would have to log in to see the 404.\r\n\r\nWhile user log in and 404 may be a rare occurrence, it just seems silly.  There could also be other use cases where a wild card route is used to set up something and the next route is expected to make use of the something and clean up after it.  If a next route doesn't actually exist, the clean up step won't be performed.\r\n\r\nTo make wild card routes more useful when chaining routes, a hasNext property has been added to the request object that gets passed to all route callback functions.  The hasNext property is an integer count of routes left to be dispatched after this one.  It will be 0 if there are no more routes, so req.hasRoute could be used as a simple condition to pre detect 404 errors."

The source has several hacks or otherwise weird design:\r\n  * `ButtonCore` has a [`_renderUI`](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/button/js/core.js#L86) method, even though it doesn\'t extend Widget.\r\n  * `Button`\'s `HTML_PARSER.label` [sets an instance variable](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/button/js/button.js#L150) (marked with `TODO: remove`)\r\n  * As [noted in `button.js`](https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/master/src/button/js/button.js#L183), toggle functionality is currently not pluggable\r\n3. The examples in [Quick Start docs](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/button/#button-widgets) don\'t `render()` the `Button`s. Without `render()`, `bindUI()` and `syncUI()` aren\'t called.\r\n4. Button supports only text labels. I\'d like to use something like\r\n`<button type="button"><img src="sprite.png"> Toggle</button>`\r\n(which is valid HTML), but that\'s not currently possible. A plugin would do the job, but as noted above, `ButtonPlugin` only provides the `ButtonCore` API.\r\n5. `ButtonGroup.disable()` doesn\'t disable its children (I\'ll create a pull request for that)\r\n\r\nI\'d like to work on these issues, but I need some detailed guidance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n- [x] - 1.

957,'ekashida',"If a `use` statement results in both css and js downloads, they should happen in parallel\n[Original ticket](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2532902)\r\n\r\nSummary of the original email thread by @sdesai for clarity:\r\n\r\na) As of 3.5.0 a Y.Get.css() call blocks a subsequent Y.Get.js() call, until the css call is done. This is by design.\r\nb) As of 3.5.0, a Y.Get.js() call blocks a subsequent Y.Get.js() call, until the first js call is done. This is by design.\r\n\r\nI believe both of these changes in behavior were introduced consciously in 3.5.0, to provide the safest behavior out of the box by default. Prior to 3.5.0 one Y.Get.script() or Y.Get.link() call wouldn't block another AFAIK (need to confirm).\r\n\r\nLoader/use makes the calls to Y.Get.css(), Y.Get.js() sequentially, and doesn't manually force the second (JS) transaction to execute in parallel.\r\n\r\nTwo ways to address this - assuming we want the 3.4.1 behavior back for use(), where CSS is loaded independently of JS:\r\n\r\n1) In loader/use, force the 2nd (JS) transaction to execute in parallel with the first (CSS) transaction.\r\n2) Revert Y.Get to the non-blocking 3.4.1 behavior (need to confirm) as far as separate Y.Get.js() or Y.Get.css() calls go.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that we should consider 2) for the following reasons:\r\ni) Y.Get is a fundamentally async API, and from the API standpoint it's unexpected for the following calls to block each other. They're unrelated calls:\r\n```\r\nY.Get.css(url, callback);\r\n...\r\nY.Get.js(url, callback);\r\n...\r\nY.Get.js(url, callback);\r\n```\r\nii) Applying i) to the use-case standpoint, the current behavior means that 2 completely unrelated pieces of code/modules making Y.Get.js() calls, block each other by default. So, for example, a\r\nstandalone Pictures module and a standalone Locations module end up blocking each other, when making 2 completely independent YQL calls - resulting in poor performance, for the default mode. On the flip side if scripts do have dependencies that need to be serialized when pulled in dynamically, that piece of knowledge is contained with a single piece of code/module and it's trivial for that module to group them in a transaction (which is serialized by default):\r\n`Y.Get.js([scriptOne, scriptTwo]);`\r\nThe API already provides a trivial and clean way to handle related scripts.\r\niii) There was a regression in API behavior going from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0 - from non-blocking to blocking (again, assuming that's true - need to confirm).\r\n\r\nIf we can get agreement on 2) being the right way to approach this, feel free to re-assign to Get."

910,'lsmith',"delegate() does not silence events bubbled from inside disabled buttons\n@sdesai @msweeney @ericf - do you have an opinion on this?\r\n\r\nThis is a tough call, but I *think* `delegate()` shouldn't execute the subscriber when an event originates from inside a disabled element.\r\n\r\nSee here for reference: http://jsbin.com/owidof/1/edit\r\n\r\nIf you click on the label that's wrapped in a `<span>`, it will alert, even though the button is disabled. If you click elsewhere in the button, it won't alert. However, for the button without a `<span>` wrapping the label, it won't alert at all.\r\n\r\nHere's the background:\r\n`delegate()` had special logic added to it to normalize IE's behavior for events on disabled elements. IE emits the events from the element's parent, which then bubbles up to the delegate filter function. Other browsers don't emit an event at all from disabled elements. The new logic checks the target _specifically_ to see if it is a disabled element and aborts the filtering loop.\r\n\r\nI think the subscriber shouldn't be fired when a button's child element is clicked because\r\nit complicates the use case of event handling for disabled elements, making it necessary for developers to both understand and handle the case where e.g. clicking on part of a button will fire an event, but on another part, there is no event."

639,'ezequiel','[Loader] Sorting modules incorrectly when YUI.GlobalConfig.groups is configurated\nWhen we upgrade our site from 3.5.1 to 3.8.0, a strange error occurs again and again. The code is very simple:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar nlAddCart = Y.all(\'.add-cart\');\r\nnlAddCart.on(\'click\', function (e) {\r\n    e.halt();\r\n    // do sth\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThere are two items in `nlAddCart`, but neither acts as we wish when a click event happens.\r\n\r\nI spend one day to find out the reason, and finally get it:\r\n\r\nStep 1: `YUI.GlobalConfig` is initialized with a object `o`, which has a `groups` property to contain all our modules:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.GlobalConfig = {\r\n    // ...\r\n    groups: {\r\n        fecore: {\r\n            \'mt-base\': {\r\n                requires: [\'yui\', \'node-base\'],\r\n                path: //...\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 2: when a new YUI instance `Y` is created, `o.groups` is mixed to `Y.config`\r\n\r\nStep 3: when `Y.use` is called for the first time, a new `Y.Loader` instance, named `loader`, is created with `Y.config`. `loader._config` is automatically called in the construction process,  and then `loader.addGroup`, and then `loader.addModule`,\r\n```javascript\r\n// https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.8.0/build/yui/yui.js#L6653\r\nthis.moduleInfo[name] = o;\r\n```\r\nall module meta on `YUI.GlobalConfig.groups` is assigned to `loader.moduleInfo`.\r\n\r\nStep 4: in the `loader._explode` method (explode all modules directly or indirectly required by used modules, it is called by `loader.calculate` in `Y.use`), an important method `loader.getRequires` is called to collect all modules directly or indirectly required by current module, and assign this collection result to the module\'s property `expanded/expanded_map`. Therefore, the meta in `YUI.GlobalConfig` is changed globally. To optimize performance, `loader.getRequires` detects some features to avoid needless computing: \r\n```javascript\r\n// https://github.com/yui/yui3/blob/v3.8.0/build/yui/yui.js#L7012\r\nreparse = !((!this.lang || mod.langCache === this.lang) && (mod.skinCache === this.skin.defaultSkin));\r\n\r\nif (mod.expanded && !reparse) {\r\n    return mod.expanded;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep 5: in the `loader._sort` method called after `loader._explode`, a comparison method `loader._require(mod1, mod2)` is called for each pair of modules to determine which should be put ahead. The `expanded/expanded_map` property of a module plays a big role.\r\n\r\nStep 6: in the first `YUI.use(\'mt-base\')` statement, all modules required by \'mt-base\' are processed by `loader.getRequire` method and consequently gets the `expanded/expanded_map` property. But when `YUI.use(\'mt-base\')` runs in the second time, as \'mt-base\' already has `expanded`, `skinCache`, and `langCache` properties, `loader.getRequire` returns `expanded` result directly according to Step 4. Therefore, every YUI built-in modules required by \'mt-base\' havs no `expanded` property, finally, `loader._sort` method computes a wrong sequence. In this example, the order is:\r\n```javascript\r\n["yui", "node-base", "event-base", "event-custom-base", "oop", "yui-base", "node-core", "dom-core", "features", "selector", "selector-native", "dom-base", "mt-base"]\r\n```\r\nThis causes `Y._attach` process \'event-base\' before \'dom-core\' and \'dom-base\', and further results in `shouldIterate` method gets a wrong answer. So, `nlAddCart.on` fails.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this problem is caused by two points:\r\n- meta info on `YUI.GlobalConfig` is used and modified by `loader.getRequires`\r\n- the optimization of `loader.getRequires` results in some YUI builtin modules missing `expanded/expanded_map` property, and finally causes `loader._sort` gives a wrong module sequence.\r\n\r\nThe full code:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.GlobalConfig = {\r\n    root: \'...\',\r\n    combine: true,\r\n    comboBase: \'...\',\r\n    groups: {\r\n        fecore: {\r\n            \'mt-base\': {\r\n                requires: [\'yui\', \'node-base\'],\r\n                path: \'...\'\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nYUI().use(\'mt-base\', function (Y) {\r\n    // do sth\r\n});\r\nYUI().use(\'mt-base\', function (Y) {\r\n    var nlAddCart = Y.all(\'.add-cart\');\r\n    nlAddCart.on(\'click\', function (e) {\r\n        e.halt();\r\n        // do sth\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

524,'ezequiel','Issues with loader\'s combine and comboBase\nI have a very simple config like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.applyConfig({\r\n    "comboBase": "/assets/js?",\r\n    "root": "yui-3.9.0/",\r\n    "groups": {\r\n        "template": {\r\n            "root": "template/",\r\n            "modules": {\r\n                "some-module": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module/some-module-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n                "some-module2": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module2/some-module2-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe documentation states that `combine` should be `true` by default.\r\n\r\nSo, if I run this code (http://jsfiddle.net/KVBHW/):\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.Env.Sandbox = YUI().use(\'selector-css3\', \'some-module\', \'some-module2\', function (Y) {\t\r\n   \r\n});\r\n```\r\nI would expect that my modules are combined. However, firebug shows otherwise:\r\n![1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2263040/279249/802e287a-9116-11e2-92ee-814592f044ba.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition, instead of using my `comboBase`, it tried to load those modules from yahoo\'s CDN. From my understanding of the docs, when we set a `comboBase`, in the root of the config, all other groups should use it, unless they have overridden it. \r\n\r\nHowever, if `combine` is explicitly set to `true` within a group it uses the correct combo base and combines the files (http://jsfiddle.net/GbpJu/):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nYUI.applyConfig({\r\n    "comboBase": "/assets/js?",\r\n    "root": "yui-3.9.0/",\r\n    "groups": {\r\n        "template": {\r\n            "combine": true,\r\n            "root": "template/",\r\n            "modules": {\r\n                "some-module": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module/some-module-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n                "some-module2": {\r\n                    "requires": ["node"],\r\n                    "path": "some-module2/some-module2-min.js"\r\n                },\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n![2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2263040/279254/067dadba-9117-11e2-8ca7-5d7276ecbdb9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n'
505,'lsmith',"Unexpected Behavior When Preventing FireOnce Event\nThis is an enhancement request and a defect report.\r\nI've demonstrated the behavior here: http://jsbin.com/ihumah/1/edit\r\n\r\nA `fireOnce` event only has one opportunity to either complete or not complete.  If it gets prevented, it can't get fired later.  I suppose this makes sense; it can literally be `.fire`d once.  I would like to be able to create an event very similar to a `fireOnce` event, but if it gets prevented, it can continue to be fired again until it completes.\r\n\r\nAfter a `fireOnce` event gets prevented, new subscribers to `.on` and `.after` get executed immediately.  This seems very broken.  This might be a copy of http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2530477"
