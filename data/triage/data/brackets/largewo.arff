Collapsed sections are remembered per project as view state.\r\n    * Also simplifies the rule list UI code in MultiRangeInlineEditor: we now simply re-render the whole list when items are added/removed, instead of trying to update it incrementally.  Also removes unneeded async code in `_updateSelectedMarker()`, unused arg in `sizeInlineWidgetToContents()`, and a few other smaller things.\r\n\r\n* The initially selected result is now the first _non-collapsed_ result; if all results are collapsed, an explanation is shown in the editor area.  One exception: if there's only one result it's always selected even if collapsed, since the rule list is hidden when there's only one result, leaving no way to expand the collapsed section.\r\n\r\n* Consistently sort Quick Edit results (previously, their order was nondeterministic -- the cause of some intermittent unit test failures!).  By default, MRIE sorts in the same order as Find in Files.  In CSS Quick Edit, there's extra logic to bubble up all LESS/SCSS files to the top of the list.\r\n    * This PR **changes the Find in Files sort order** - on master, files with deeper nesting are listed before shallower files with the same path prefix (e.g. `/project/folder/subfolder/foo.js` comes before `/project/folder/bar.js`)... and thus any files at the project root are always listed last.  This PR reverses that: shallower items are listed higher, and thus any files at the project root are always listed first.\r\n    * This also changes the sort order of the New Rule dropdown to be consistent with the Quick Edit order.  Previously, files were sorted primarily on filename (files with the same name in very different folders appeared next to each other in the list).  Now it uses the 'standard sort order' shared with Find in Files, sorting primarily on folder (files in the same folder appear next to each other in the list, regardless of filename).  Duplicate filenames still display extra path snippets to disambiguate them in the dropdown."

I suspect that many reported problems and open issues are related to this subtle difference.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that live preview caches HTMLDocument objects, but the Document and Editor objects that it references are only maintained when doc is in the working set. When doc is not in the working set, a new Document and Editor object is created every time it is selected in project tree.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes 2 changes:\r\n\r\n1. HTMLDocument now ref counts `this.doc` Document so it persists while Live Preview is connected.\r\n\r\n2. HTMLDocument now listens for `activeEditorChange` event to handle Editor changes.

8284,'dangoor','Feature: Use Google\'s Polymer and Material Design\nGoogle\'s new Polymer framework has recently added Google\'s paper material design. I propose that Brackets starts the integration of web components (as presented at [Polymer\'s website](http://www.polymer-project.org)) . Polymer allows developers to extend HTML by providing an interface for defining their own tags. This would provide an architecture change in the HTML layout of brackets that is broken down by component on the HTML side of things, greatly simplifying the final HTML layout of Brackets. It provides code that is more legible and is more clearly organized than a typical HTML page (although it is reminiscent of XHTML).\r\n\r\nRather than trying to explain its use to the Brackets team and developers, let me first give you an insight on translating current HTML as laid out in Brackets to Polymer HTML.\r\n\r\nInstead of `<div id="sidebar" class="sidebar panel quiet-scrollbars horz-resizable right-resizer collapsible" data-minsize="0" data-forceleft=".content" style="box-sizing: border-box;">......</div>` you could have `<sidebar>.....</sidebar>`\r\n\r\nInstead of `<div class="content">....</div>` you could have `<content>....</content>`\r\n\r\nInstead of the trivial bootstrap example with super-complexities in a modal:\r\n```\r\n<!-- Button trigger modal -->\r\n<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal">\r\n  Launch demo modal\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<!-- Modal -->\r\n<div class="modal fade" id="myModal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">\r\n  <div class="modal-dialog">\r\n    <div class="modal-content">\r\n      <div class="modal-header">\r\n        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button>\r\n        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Modal title</h4>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="modal-body">\r\n        ...\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class="modal-footer">\r\n        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>\r\n        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nyou could have:\r\n```\r\n<!-- Button trigger modal -->\r\n<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal">\r\n  Launch demo modal\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<!-- Modal -->\r\n<modal id="myModal">\r\n    <modal-header>\r\n      <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button>\r\n      <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Modal title</h4>\r\n    </modal-header>\r\n    <modal-body>\r\n      ...\r\n    </modal-body>\r\n    <modal-footer>\r\n      <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>\r\n      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>\r\n    </modal-footer>\r\n</modal>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow extension developers to more easily extend brackets using a bootstrap of Brackets components for developers to use, without having to worry about applying one of the brackets-defined classes to get a component to look or work right if extension developers are looking to manipulate the internal DOM of brackets rather than use JS classes for tabs (Tab), etc.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Another clear benefit I noticed about the Polymerized Bootstrap example was that the heirarchy of elements was clearer and more intuitive.'

The `release-0.41` tag is _incorrect_ (it points to a newer SHA on master), but unfortunately that\'s the tag our downloads are attached to on Github.com.\r\n\r\nTo fix this we should:\r\n* Force-update the `release-0.41` tag to point to the correct SHA (the one `sprint-41` currently points to).  (See http://stackoverflow.com/a/21127037/1172352 for info on how to do this).\r\n* Remove the `sprint-41` tag\r\n* Make sure the Github.com download link still works (i.e. the tag still has the downloads attached and the tag hasn\'t been set back to the "draft" state)\r\n\r\nWe should probably wait a few days until the update notification spike is past, just in case the downloads get temporarily broken again in the process of fixing this.\r\n\r\nWe also may need to ask people to do a special type of `git fetch` after doing this -- IIRC, force-updated tags are not automatically updated locally after a fetch/pull for some reason.'

7809,'peterflynn',"[replace-across-files] Replace in Files\nThis is all the work for Replace in Files after the find bar unification (which is in #7705). There were probably a few changes to the find bar after that PR, but the work was fairly separable (and some of the code moved around after that), so it's probably worth reviewing that one first/separately anyway.\r\n\r\nHigh-level points:\r\n\r\n* `FindInFiles` was refactored into multiple pieces:\r\n    * `FindInFiles` is now just the cross-file search and replace engine code, with no UI logic. (The replace code is actually primarily in FindUtils, because I thought I was going to need it in two places, but it turns out I don't because single-file Replace All went away - see below.) FindInFiles also takes care of listening for document/file change events and updating the SearchModel incrementally. (Note, however, that those updates only happen in Find mode. In Replace mode, we shut the panel immediately whenever a change happens to any document that was found by the initial search, to avoid complexity with updating the checkbox state, etc. We have a [Trello card](https://trello.com/c/tfTFQV8e) for more sophisticated update behavior during Replace.)\r\n    * `FindBar` handles the modal bar UI for both single-file Find/Replace and Find/Replace In Files (that work was done in #7705).\r\n    * `SearchModel` encapsulates the query and results state for Find In Files and Replace In Files.\r\n    * `SearchResultsView` manages the results panel for Find In Files and Replace In Files, including paging and (in replace mode) the checkboxes for choosing what to replace. It listens to SearchModel for updates to the results. This is mostly from work done by @TomMalbran to unify the old single-file Replace All panel with the Find in Files panel.\r\n    * `FindInFilesUI` is the controller module that sews all the above together and actually handles the menu commands, etc.\r\n* Single-file `Replace All` is no longer has its code for running the search/replace; it just delegates to FindInFilesUI, passing the current file as the scope. Also, we took the opportunity to rename it from `All...` to `Batch...` since we've heard people be confused by the original naming.\r\n* You can now safely kick off a search or replace programmatically by calling `FindInFilesUI.searchAndShowResults()` with the query/scope/filter info (as requested in #7445). If you wanted, you could even do a completely headless search or replace by calling directly into `FindInFiles.doSearchInScope()`.\r\n\r\nI'll add comments throughout the diffs on what has changed."

7648,'RaymondLim','Problem with indentation in python files.\nBrackets does a great job in automatically aligning the caret with the opening parenthesis when writing a list/tuple/etc. in the following fashion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint("This is a long sentence - I\'d be better off splitting it up",\r\n      "into a bunch of smaller chunks, because it doesn\'t fit into",\r\n      "a single line.")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever sometimes it\'s much more convenient to write a list/tuple/etc. using more traditional indentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresulting_variable = module_with_a_long_name.some_package.do_something_fancy(\r\n    "this first parameter is also longish",\r\n    "and it\'s much more readable,",\r\n    "when placed below the function call.",\r\n    "Not to mention line-length conventions used in the Python community."\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the latter case Brackets places the caret at the beginning of the line after each linebreak - instead of properly indenting it like it does in other languages. That can really get frustrating in the long run.'

In any case, this commit fixes things to restore our previous behavior:\r\n\r\n* We always set `primIndex` to the last item in the selection if no primary selection is specified.\r\n* Some of the selection-related unit tests were testing things by directly setting the selection in CodeMirror and then reading it back via our APIs.

This results in the desired behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo to sum up: \r\n* If you have a cursor at a line (with no selection), hitting Ctrl-X will cut the whole line. \r\n* If you have a text selection, hitting Ctrl-X will work normal as before. \r\n* Any combinations with multiple cursors is supported."

Now a combination of the two words has been inserted at both cursors (which is not the same behaviour as when only words are selected). So now instead of having "foo\\nfoo\\n" and "barbar" we have "foo\\nfoo\\n\\nbar" and "barfoo\\n\\nbar".\r\n\r\nEDIT: Below is just a personal opinion and is not really the bug. Since Sublime doesn\'t behave as described below, I understand that we might skip my suggestion below.

Right now, if you have two selections and copy-paste, it would be the same behaviour as if i did each copy paste separately (which is cool). However, if doing copy with two selections and then one of the cursors is removed (so only one is left) then I think that a paste should result in only the previously primary selection should be pasted (not the merge of the two previously selections).'

If you hit tab at the beginning of a whitespace-only line, we used to autoindent to the right level. Now we just insert another indent. This brings back the original behavior (and adds unit tests for it).\r\n\r\nNote that the ideal fix here would be to do autoindent when you're anywhere in a whitespace-only line if the amount of whitespace is less than or equal to the correct indent level. However, this isn't easy for us to fix because we can't easily tell in advance what the right indent level is, so we don't know if you're before it or past it (and if you're past it, we don't want to autoindent on Tab, since that would actually outdent; we want to just add another indent in that case). So, the prior behavior (which this reinstates) is to only do the autoindent if the cursor is at the left edge of the line to begin with.\r\n\r\nThat same issue prevents us from autoindenting when you're immediately before the first non-whitespace character in the line.

This is because we just rely on running CM\'s autoindent code in this case, and we don\'t want the autoindent to take effect if the line is already indented past the "correct" indentation - we want to just keep inserting tabs in that case. If we had a way to know whether we were past the "correct" indent level, we could fix this, but there isn\'t a good way to do that without implementing autoindent ourselves (which we could do by copying some of CM\'s code).'

7109,'jasonsanjose',"Fix bug with file caching\nThis is a fix for #7006 and #6978. @peterflynn wrote the fix and I added a test. Peter's commit has a good description of the problem:\r\n\r\nFix bug where file caches aren't cleared when the parent directory changes\r\n\r\nif that directory's own parent (the file's grandparent) has changed recently:\r\n1. Grandparent dir gets change event. Calls _clearCachedData() on all immediate children\r\n2. File's parent dir is one of those children, so it erases its _contents\r\n3. File's parent dir gets change event of its own.\r\n4. Since it has no _content, it has no idea what children it has, and thus\r\nfails to clear any of them.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use FileIndex to find children when cached dir content is\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nGlenn noted we might consider simply not clearing child dirs' content (only\r\nclear child files), but NJ pointed out we don't have any firm guarantee\r\nthat a file's parent dir is ever read before the file itself is read - so\r\nthis bug could repro in other cases. (It just so happens that JS code hints\r\ncall visitAll() very early in typical Brackets usage, but there's no\r\nguarantee in general). So we really shouldn't ever require cached dir\r\ncontent for clearing children, regardless of what grandparent change\r\nhandling does."

6956,'redmunds',"[cmv4] Fix issues with doc syncing in inline editors\nAlso addresses #6039. This PR fixes two problems:\r\n\r\n* In v4, CodeMirror sends multiple `change` events for a single operation, unlike in v3 where it would send a linked list of all the edits in a single `change`. This PR changes our `change` event to use the new `changes` event in v4, which sends an array of edits. That means our `change` event API will break anyone who was using the old linked list, but a quick survey of extensions showed that the only extension that was even looking at that argument was @peterflynn's Go to Last Edit extension.\r\n    * Note that as part of this, I also fixed an apparent bug in ScopeManager where it was only looking at the first change record in the list. @dangoor might want to take a look at this.\r\n* `doMultipleEdits()` had a bad bug where it was doing each edit in the current Editor's `_codeMirror` instead of the underlying Document's `_codeMirror`, which was bad since it was the Document that was batching the edits.\r\n\r\nWith this, multiselect edits seem to be working properly within inline editors.\r\n\r\n@redmunds\r\n"

6815,'dangoor','User can now specify a port for the live dev server\n**Overview**\r\nThese changes allow a user to specify a fixed port number, via a preference, for the Live Development server.  This fixes the the now-closed [Issue 5626](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/5626).\r\n\r\n**Use Cases**\r\nI was struggling with the changing of port numbers while developing an application which used IndexedDB as well as the Google Drive API.  \r\n\r\nIndexedDB databases are host and port specific, thus any development data I stored while using one port number was lost each time I closed and reopened Brackets.\r\n\r\nWith the Google Drive API, applications must be served from hosts (and port) that the developer has registered through the API\'s console, thus I needed to be log into the Google API Console and update it each time Brackets was closed and reopened.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nThe StaticServer extension was the only area modified in order to support a user-specified port.  StaticServer is Bracket\'s internal HTTP server, and is used solely by the LiveDevelopment module.  Three sets of changes were necessary:\r\n\r\n*StaticServerDomain.js*\r\nStaticServerDomain, the actual server code executed in the node process, was updated to accept a port number in it\'s `getServer` command.  If the passed in port isn\'t a valid port number or if the port number is already in use, StaticServerDomain will fallback to it\'s original behavior of serving from a random port.  It may be desirable to log a warning when this happens, but I didn\'t code that.\r\n\r\nThe "listening" callback used when calling server.listen was factored out to a long-term listener now added via `server.on("listening", fn)`.  This accommodates a second call to server.listen that appears in the `server.on("error", fn)` which could get called in the event that the specified port is already in use.\r\n\r\nIt\'s important to note that the public API for getServer has changed from `getServer(host, cb)` to `getServer(host, port, cb)`.  There was only one place in core that needed updating for this as well as the unit tests, but this would break anyone else\'s extensions that explicitely call getServer.\r\n\r\n*StaticServer.js*\r\nStaticServer is the Bracket-side wrapper around the node domain.  It was changed to accept a port number in the config object that is passed to it\'s constructor.  StaticServer doesn\'t do anything with the port number other than pass it along to the node domain when calling getServer.\r\n\r\n*main.js*\r\nStaticServer\'s main.js pulls the user-specified port from preferences using the key "liveDevPort" and passes that value into the StaticServer constructor.\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\nI added two tests.  One tests that the specified port is used when it\'s passed in.  The other tests that a random port is used if the specified port is already in use.  The default case, when a port isn\'t specified by the user, is tested explicitly in an existing test.\r\n'

Note that the first time this runs in the Brackets project, you might see JSLint run twice (once when CodeInspection turns on and again when the JSLint preferences are set)... but this is legitimate because both of those changes could result in different lint results.

We should either make `toggleEnabled()` short-circuit out of no-op changes, or make `updateListeners()` robust to redundant calls (e.g. if it used a function outside its closure then jQuery wouldn't register it multiple times).\r\n\r\n@dangoor Do you have cycles to take this?

6660,'dangoor','Preferences Scope creation reliability improvements\nIf a Scope fails to load and other Scopes depend upon it (because of a "before" relationship), then none of those Scopes load. A Scope can fail to load because the JSON fails to parse, for example.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we needed to implement [a less pleasant solution](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/commit/e1c3b88191774447824d784faed5fbbdd9806219#diff-fc3cb1f10cb5cef9a7b00ef0e06e4d81R233) for ensuring that the "session" Scope was loaded with the highest precedence of the built-in Scopes. As written, that solution would mean that if there was an error in the user\'s brackets.json file, the path Scopes and session Scope will all not be added.\r\n\r\nTo complicate matters, the "user" Scope is kind of important because that\'s where settings should largely go by default. If the user\'s brackets.json file fails to load, I don\'t think we want to not have a "user" Scope, but we also want to avoid trashing the user\'s data if they have settings in brackets.json but just have a syntax error.\r\n\r\ncc @busykai'

[A recent change to CSSUtils.js] \r\n(https://github.com/adobe/brackets/commit/d6eacd631f0b1385d38fcdf9775927757cca46b8) brought updates to the internal methods used for `getInfoAtPos()`, perhaps to sync with CodeMirror API updates. \r\n\r\nI tracked down the issue to a undefined context got from CodeMirror when focusing the cursor inside the functional value notation __only when__ the value contains a modifier, for example: polygon(__n|onzero__, 0 0)\r\n\r\n    function getInfoAtPos(editor, constPos) {\r\n        ...\r\n        ctx = TokenUtils.getInitialContext(editor._codeMirror, pos) // undefined\r\n\r\nI have tried debugging CodeMirror for a few hours, but it has proved beyond my understanding. \r\nCan someone please help me look into this issue? \r\n\r\nThe result I\'m looking for is a correct CSS info object from `CSSUtils.getInfoAtPos()` when querying the functional notation value both with and without the modifier. I suspect this issue may also affect gradients - linear and radial - which can use modifiers such as "top", "left", "right" and so forth.'

It makes some effort to ensure that successive calls to `refreshFileTree` are not interleaved, and ensures that there is at least a one second delay between calls. It also gives up on adding/removing individual entries to the tree as a result of file system events in lieu of a single full refresh if the queue of changes becomes too large.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization is imperfect, but hopefully better than what exists now. \r\n\r\nAside: performance is still very bad in case we get filesystem change events for a directory that is both open in the file tree and that has many (~1000) files. I think a big reason for this is the complexity of `_findTreeNode`.

Clients can then interpret or process the bytes arbitrarily. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the command ID can always be encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer, IDs are now restricted to the range `0 <= id < 2^32`.

It is still at the bottom of the view menu.\r\n\r\nThe number "3" is printed in the console log.  brackets.app.removeMenuItem() has thrown an error.\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2**:\r\nOpen Brackets source code, then open Dev Tools to Console and paste the following code snippet into the Console:\r\n```javascript\r\nbrackets.app.addMenuItem("view-menu", "---", "brackets-menuDivider-1001", "", "", undefined, undefined, function (err) { console.log(err); });\r\n```\r\nLook at the view menu.

6268,'RaymondLim','Integrate latest CodeMirror for sprint 36\n*Update:* Removed "[discussion only]" tag since we think we\'ve addressed the issues and could merge this.\r\n\r\nIn the latest CM (as of marijnh/CodeMirror@d13582f), the CSS mode has been refactored substantially. The good news is that LESS is now supported by CSS mode, meaning that we can much more easily make basic code hinting work for LESS files (similar to what we\'ve already done for SCSS files). The less good news is that the internals of the mode have changed significantly. In particular:\r\n\r\n* There\'s no longer a `stack` member on the `state` object, but instead a `context` member which seems to fulfill the same role (using a linked list instead of a stack).\r\n* Some of the token types appear to have changed (specifically, `propertyValue` now seems to be `prop`).\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a quick attempt to make the existing CSS code hinting work properly with the changes to CSS mode. It also hooks up LESS files to the CSS mode (instead of the old LESS mode) and attempts to turn on code hinting in those files.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, it looks like almost all the existing CSS code hinting unit tests pass, except for one in CSS Context Info. However, I haven\'t done much manual testing beyond verifying that basic property and value hints seem to work in CSS and LESS files. Also, this was based on only a **very** cursory understanding of the existing CSSUtils code and of the changes to the CM CSS mode, so it\'s quite likely that we need to do more work and testing to make sure everything is working properly.\r\n\r\n@RaymondLim - would you mind taking a look at the code changes and seeing what you think? I\'m wondering if we need to add a story for this (to ensure we get adequate testing, etc.), which might mean pushing it to the next sprint.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there were a number of other smaller changes since our last CM merge that are probably worth testing around. From looking at the commit log, these are the areas we\'d want to do some sanity testing around:\r\n\r\n   * Inline editor line hiding (esp at beginning/end of doc) - make fix first\r\n   * LESS - using CSS mode now! - include that and test\r\n   * XML-mode\r\n   * Auto-closing of HTML tags\r\n   * Look for gutter issues\r\n   * Hit up arrow while selection exists\r\n   * Scroll into view\r\n   * newline and indent\r\n   * electric chars\r\n   * CSS mode changes, incl. tokenization (test quick edit, quick open symbol, etc.)\r\n   * JS mode - indentation around for / forEach\r\n   * Check undo/redo/dirty bit esp. around quick typing\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR also contains the small update required by #6204. \r\n\r\n'

When I do so, I\'m getting a lot of indentation errors.\r\n\r\nEven if I just write some temporary code and plop it into ipython I\'m noticing a lot of indentation errors that are not at all shown in editing window. \r\n\r\nThe indentation error typically occurs any time there is a carriage return between blocks of code (spacing that one would use for simple visual seperation of concepts/tasks)\r\n\r\nHere\'s an example: \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Post(Document):\r\n    title = StringField(max_length=120, required=True)\r\n    author = ReferenceField(User, reverse_delete_rule=CASCADE)\r\n    tags = ListField(StringField(max_length=30))\r\n    comments = ListField(EmbeddedDocumentField(Comment))\r\n    \r\n    meta = {\'allow_inheritance\': True}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, trying to paste this into ipython directly from Brackets gives us: \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [7]: class Post(Document):\r\n   ...:         title = StringField(max_length=120, required=True)\r\n   ...:         author = ReferenceField(User, reverse_delete_rule=CASCADE)\r\n   ...:         tags = ListField(StringField(max_length=30))\r\n   ...:         comments = ListField(EmbeddedDocumentField(Comment))\r\n   ...:         \r\n\r\nIn [8]:     meta = {\'allow_inheritance\': True}\r\n  File "<ipython-input-8-a815298325dc>", line 1\r\n    meta = {\'allow_inheritance\': True}\r\n    ^\r\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a good example because it shows Brackets doing exactly what we would expect by indenting the line, following it\'s parent... but there\'s still something up with the file itself because it can\'t be processed by the python interpreter without errors. If you\'re working in Brackets, this can get really frustrating because you can\'t "see" the indentation that the interpreter is complaining about. \r\n\r\nThe image below shows the visual spacing in the Brackets editor, vs. what is actually presented when you copy and paste out of Brackets and into ipython (or simply save and try to compile in the interpreter).\r\n\r\n![ex1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/421859/1719787/2f1b42c6-61f2-11e3-8507-f9c7501c836d.png)\r\n'

Description still to be written; the text of #6052 is copied below for now.\r\n\r\nCC @gruehle @peterflynn @jasonsanjose \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is the first of what will become a two-part pull request. The first part adds file caching with consistency checks using the existing coarse cache-invalidation strategy (i.e., invalidate everything on focus). The second part will use file watchers to implement a more fine-grained cache-invalidation strategy.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n0. This pull request adds consistent cache support for all `FileSystemEntry` objects. In particular, stats are cached for `FileSystemEntry` objects, and additionally directory contents and children stat lists for `Directory` objects; and file contents for `File` objects.\r\n\r\n1. Data is only cached for watched entries. For simplicity, this is checked only at cache update time, and not at cache read time. As a consequence, cached data is used whenever it is available. Cached data is *not* purged when an entry transitions from a watched to an unwatched state because, in this case, the entry should no longer be accessed anyway. However, an entry can safely go from an unwatched to watched state, and so the watching infrastructure is responsible for calling `_setWatched` on each entry so that it knows to begin caching its data.\r\n\r\n2. The *only* time consistency checks happen are during file writes. In particular, calls to `stat` and `read` will immediately return cached data if available. This makes cached reads very fast. (On my machine, searches for occurrences of a single character in the entire Brackets project complete in under a second after data is cached.) Consistency is checked using a hash of the file's contents, which is provided by the impl. The only time the consistency hash is updated is when the contents of the are known: i.e., after reads and writes.\r\n\r\n3. A consistency check can fail during writes if the impl determines that the hash of the file on disk is different from the hash in memory. In that case, the write will fail with a new error code `FileSystemError.CONTENTS_MODIFIED`. (This error should never occur if the file is created by the write.) If a write is attempted to an existing file that has never been read (i.e., a *blind write*), the consistency check will fail because there is no hash in memory. This is a case in which the consistency check may be too strict, and so it is possible for clients to override the check by setting `blind: true` in the options parameter to the write call. There were no instances of blind writes in Brackets that required this override.\r\n\r\n4. If we fail to invalidate cached contents that have changed on disk then the user will not be notified of the change until she attempts to save. Brackets will not allow the new data on disk to be overwritten accidentally in this case because of the consistency check, but the experience would nonetheless be frustrating and disconcerting to the user. Timely cache invalidation is required to avoid this scenario. Consequently, this pull request should not be merged until file watchers can be used to perform this invalidation. \r\n\r\n## TODO 1/2/2014\r\n \r\n- [x] unit test pass\r\n- [x] startup slugishness on linux/windows for brackets and brackets-shell repos\r\n- [x] project tree unhandled exception (try compiling brackets-shell to produce lots of change events)\r\n- [x] scrub review comments from @peterflynn "

6193,'jasonsanjose','NodeDomain\nThis pull request has three parts: \r\n\r\n1. A new `NodeDomain` module, which is a high-level wrapper around `NodeConnection`. This makes it easy to open a connection and load a single domain, and then execute the domain\'s commands and listen for its events. The wrapper handles, in particular, connection and domain loading and reloading.\r\nThe inline documentation gives the following usage example:\r\n```\r\nvar myDomain = new NodeDomain("someDomain", "/path/to/SomeDomainDef");\r\n      $result = myDomain.exec("someCommand", arg1, arg2);\r\n\r\n      $result.done(function (value) {\r\n        // the command succeeded!\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      $result.fail(function (err) {\r\n        // the command failed; act accordingly!\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      $(myDomain).on("someEvent", someHandler);\r\n```\r\n2. A refactoring of `StaticServer` to use `NodeDomain` instead of manipulating `NodeConnection` directly. The previous code had been copied and pasted regularly, but had a few shortcomings, including redundant timeouts (`NodeConnection` handles this already), failure to handle disconnected sockets, and, in some cases, a silent fail-fast behavior on command execution where simply waiting would suffice. (If the `NodeConnection` isn\'t connected, don\'t abort; just wait for it to come back up!)\r\n3. Finally, it also fixes a race condition in `StaticServerDomain` that was causing the `LiveDevelopment` unit tests to fail unpredictably. \r\nThe problem is as follows: when `StaticServerDomain` receives an HTTP request for a filtered path, it emits a `filterRequest` event to Brackets to have the file contents at that path manipulated before sending the response. Brackets later calls the `writeFilteredResponse` command with the manipulated data, which triggers the HTTP response. `StaticServerDomain` connects these filtered responses to their original filter requests by way of a map of callbacks keyed on the requested paths. But, as a consequence, when the `StaticServerDomain` HTTP server receives *two* concurrent requests for the same path, it only stores *one* response callback. The second filtered response is then be dropped, no longer having any response callback at the given path, and the second request---whose response callback has been overwritten---will always time out. The problem is solved here by adding a unique identifier to each `filterRequest` and keying callbacks on this identifier.'

Instead of Yes/No/Stop, there\'s a single Replace button.\r\n* Replace now shares most of its code with Find, so Replace gets incremental search, match highlighting, match counting, and tickmark indicators.\r\n* Enter is treated as Find Next instead of closing the search bar.  (And Shift+Enter = Find Prev)\r\n* Streamlined UI: match count hovers inside query field, regexp errors appear in a popup below the query field, next/prev buttons don\'t dynamically show/hide, related buttons are clustered tightly, and eliminated labels in favor of prompt text inside the replace field.\r\n* Explicit toggles for regexp & case-insensitive -- no longer auto-detecting based on what the query string looks like.  Toggles are shared across Find, Replace, & FindInFiles and are persisted as a pref.\r\n* Find Next uses editor cursor pos rather than an invisible saved pos (this is part of the future [Correct Find Next Behavior](https://trello.com/c/0GXqt5GF/1089-correct-find-next-behavior) story, but it simplified the code here so I went ahead & did it now).\r\n* Keyboard shortcut for Replace button -- just use the regular Replace shortcut while the bar is open.  So you can do a replace operation entirely from the keyboard, just using the Find Next & Replace shortcuts.\r\n* Unit tests\r\n\r\nNot implemented yet:\r\n* Decide whether to unify Find & Replace into a single command (i.e. you\'d never see the simpler Find-only UI anymore)\r\n* Final visual polish -- make search/replace fields dynamically fill available width?

This pull request adds domain event parsing to go along with the command parsing. It just adds the event names and their signatures to the connection, accessible by `connection.domainEvents.someDomainName`. (It would have been better to add the event specifications in the same way as the commands, but this would have required either breaking changes or polluting the existing `domains` namespace. I decided to just create a separate `domainEvents` namespace where each domain\'s event specifications live.)\r\n\r\nI\'m submitting this pull request because I\'m also working on another wrapper around `NodeConnection` that exposes a simple interface for its most common usage: loading a single domain, executing its commands and listening for its events. The wrapper abstracts connection management and domain loading (and reloading). The goal is to eliminate a lot of existing boilerplate. It works like this:\r\n```\r\nvar myDomain = new NodeDomain("myDomain", "/path/to/MyDomainSpec.js");\r\n\r\nmyDomain.myCommand(param1, param2)\r\n  .done(function(value) { \r\n    /* command succeeded; use the result! */\r\n  })\r\n  .fail(function (err) {\r\n    /* command failed; deal with it! */\r\n  });\r\n\r\n$(myDomain).on("someEvent", function (param1, param2) {\r\n  /* someEvent was fired! */\r\n});\r\n```'

6052,'gruehle',"[REVIEW ONLY] File caching\nThis is the first of what will become a two-part pull request. The first part adds file caching with consistency checks using the existing coarse cache-invalidation strategy (i.e., invalidate everything on focus). The second part will use file watchers to implement a more fine-grained cache-invalidation strategy.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n0. This pull request adds consistent cache support for all `FileSystemEntry` objects. In particular, stats are cached for `FileSystemEntry` objects, and additionally directory contents and children stat lists for `Directory` objects; and file contents for `File` objects.\r\n\r\n1. Data is only cached for watched entries. For simplicity, this is checked only at cache update time, and not at cache read time. As a consequence, cached data is used whenever it is available. Cached data is *not* purged when an entry transitions from a watched to an unwatched state because, in this case, the entry should no longer be accessed anyway. However, an entry can safely go from an unwatched to watched state, and so the watching infrastructure is responsible for calling `_setWatched` on each entry so that it knows to begin caching its data.\r\n\r\n2. The *only* time consistency checks happen are during file writes. In particular, calls to `stat` and `read` will immediately return cached data if available. This makes cached reads very fast. (On my machine, searches for occurrences of a single character in the entire Brackets project complete in under a second after data is cached.) Consistency is checked using a hash of the file's contents, which is provided by the impl. The only time the consistency hash is updated is when the contents of the are known: i.e., after reads and writes.\r\n\r\n3. A consistency check can fail during writes if the impl determines that the hash of the file on disk is different from the hash in memory. In that case, the write will fail with a new error code `FileSystemError.CONTENTS_MODIFIED`. (This error should never occur if the file is created by the write.) If a write is attempted to an existing file that has never been read (i.e., a *blind write*), the consistency check will fail because there is no hash in memory. This is a case in which the consistency check may be too strict, and so it is possible for clients to override the check by setting `blind: true` in the options parameter to the write call. There were no instances of blind writes in Brackets that required this override.\r\n\r\n4. If we fail to invalidate cached contents that have changed on disk then the user will not be notified of the change until she attempts to save. Brackets will not allow the new data on disk to be overwritten accidentally in this case because of the consistency check, but the experience would nonetheless be frustrating and disconcerting to the user. Timely cache invalidation is required to avoid this scenario. Consequently, this pull request should not be merged until file watchers can be used to perform this invalidation. \r\n\r\nCC @gruehle @peterflynn \r\n \r\n"

Landing this breaking change *before* the current sprint ends should thus be considered highly desirable!\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, @peterflynn has already signed off on the high-level idea of this change. I'd like @gruehle to do so too, so I'm tentatively assigning to him in order to force a :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown:, though he may wish to kick it back to @peterflynn to scrutinize my semicolons.\r\n"

5943,'gruehle',"Avoid symbolic link cycles\nThis pull request adds symbolic link cycle avoidance to `FileSystemEntry.visit`. It does this by declining to follow symbolic links in subdirectories with the same real path more than once. This ensures that calls to `visit` on directories that form part of a symbolic link cycle always converge. \r\n\r\n**Note 1:** Because this change does not affect the results of `Directory.getContents`, it is still possible to recurse into symbolic link cycles indefinitely. For example, this change does not affect manual expansion of link cycles in the file tree. Furthermore, code that naively traverses directory structures can still diverge! The only example I could find in the Brackets source that performs such a naive traversal is the JS code hinter. Pull request #5917 replaces these ad hoc traversals with calls to `visit`, which solves the problem.\r\n\r\n**Note 2:** The `visit` method could also have been modified such that the object itself is not visited if its real path has previously been visited instead of performing this check on the children of Directory objects. This would have a somewhat cleaner implementation, but would require an additional `stat` call. Because Brackets is sensitive to the performance of the `visit` method, I opted against the slightly cleaner implementation in favor of a slightly more performant one.\r\n\r\n**Note 3:** For this change to have any effect, a change is required in the behavior of `FileSystemImpl.stat` such that when applied to a symbolic link, the returned `FileSystemStats` object should have an additional property, `realPath`, which evaluates to the canonical path of the target of the link. The `size`, `mtime`, `isFile` and `isDirectory` properties must still describe the target of the link, not the link itself. (Do not confuse the semantics of this function with the semantics of POSIX `lstat`, for example.) For non-links, the behavior of `stat` is unchanged.\r\n\r\n**Note 4:** *This change has not yet been made to `AppshellFileSystemImpl` and the Brackets shell.* Merging this change before the corresponding shell changes have landed won't make anything worse, but, still, this code should be considered for-review-only. In the meantime, it can be tested using the [Node filesystem branch](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/tree/iwehrman/nodefs), which makes use of the `NodeFileSystemImpl` for which the [semantics of stat have already been updated](https://github.com/iwehrman/brackets-node-filesystem/blob/master/node/NodeFileSystemDomain.js#L45).\r\n\r\nAddresses #5892."

If you then need to check out master again, just do `git submodule update --init` again afterwards to get it back. You need git 1.8.4 or later to use `deinit`.\r\n\r\nSmart-autocomplete didn't distinguish between arrow-key selection and mouse hover, so if you happened to bump the mouse over the list while using Quick Open and then hit Enter, it would select the item the mouse was over instead of the first item or the item you selected with arrow keys. \r\n\r\nWe decided to go ahead and just monkeypatch smart-autocomplete since we will likely replace it in the future anyway. So, the first commit below (7338907) just pulls in the latest source from the upstream repo into `smart-auto-complete-local` and removes the old submodule. It should be exactly the same except that I added a note at the beginning of the README indicating where it came from.\r\n\r\nThe second commit (faf21e0) reverts a patch in the upstream repo that breaks Quick Open in Brackets. Its original intention was to make it so holding down the arrow keys would properly repeat. We should eventually look at a fix for that, but it would likely require changes to the (fragile) key handling in Quick Open and smart autocomplete.\r\n\r\nThe third commit (e6f50d6) is the actual fix for this bug. It simply comments out the JS mouseenter/mouseleave handlers (so itemFocus/itemUnfocus no longer gets sent out for mouseovers), and just adds a simple highlight in CSS.

Run `grunt build` to compile `src` to a new `dist` folder\r\n3. Hold the `SHIFT` key when opening a new Brackets window and select `dist/index.html`\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* Change `index.html` to optionally include `brackets.less` vs compiled `brackets.css` via `grunt less`\r\n* Add new `grunt build` task to compile less and concat thirdparty libs, compile, minify and generate source map for brackets src/**/*.js\r\n* Change `main.js` to be compatible with r.js\r\n* Minor changes to extensions and ShellAPI to account for new compile steps\r\n* Update `.gitignore`\r\n\r\nSource Maps:\r\n* JavaScript source maps are supported as of brackets-shell for sprint 34\r\n* LESS source maps are _not_ supported in brackets-shell (requires CEF with Chrome 30+). Source maps are generated and can be tested in Chrome. Verified on Chrome 31.\r\n\r\nOn my Mac, `document.ready` time is reduced from ~2.5s to ~1.4s, largely due to the compiled LESS code. Adding JavaScript minification brings `document.ready` time down to ~1.0s.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, we I go from ~3.8s to ~2.3s with LESS compiled only. ~2.0s with minification.\r\n\r\nStill need to update brackets-shell packaging tasks.\r\n\r\n~~This setup requires developers to install node and grunt to compile `brackets.less` to `brackets.css`. The other option would be to commit the compiled `brackets.css` to the repo. This would mean adding a 2nd generated file that I know of in addition to `/src/config.json`. We didn't pull the trigger on requiring node and grunt for contributors in the past so that the barrier to entry would stay low. Also, the payoff prior to now was not that great. I think we should reconsider changing the setup requirements for developers if we're averse to checking in compiled assets.~~\r\n\r\n~~I have an old open pull request to port the dev env setup to Grunt here #4577.~~\r\n\r\nUPDATE: This setup allows the current dev env setup to remain intact as far as dynamic LESS compilation. My prior assertion about requiring node+grunt no longer applies, and the case to require these tools for all developers is not as strong.\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\n\r\n1. Determine if extensions could rely on LESS mixins defined in `brackets.less` and whether or not it is desirable to so. --- ANSWER: No, trying to access variables and mixins does not work. Through our `ExtensionUtils` module, each .less file is compiled with it's own parser. Variables and mixins are only known to the parser created at startup time."

This doesn't happen for simple ID/class/tag selectors.\r\n\r\nWe could modify the test to actually diff the subtree to ensure that it's the same before and after, but in this case it seems good enough to just test that neither of the installer's methods get called (which it was already doing).

Originally, opening the inline editor in this case wouldn\'t set focus to it, but that meant that the shortcut wouldn\'t work. So I made it so that if there are no matching rules, we set focus to the "New Rule" button, which is kind of nice since it draws attention to it and you can just hit Space to activate it (or Cmd-Alt-N to use the normal shortcut).

Then brackets.inBrowser is used for two purposes: 1) whenever file system is used, it is used to warn the user that Brackets cannot be run "in a browser"; 2) it is used to decide whether construct native or HTML menus. As the result, if a filesystem is provided, by default native menu is constructed (a workaround for this has been added recently as a side-effect of #5290). This presents a problem for environments where native menus cannot be constructed, but the brackets.fs is installed and functional. Linux support is an example of this: it is treated as an exceptional use-case ([Global.js:92](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/utils/Global.js#L92)). Intel XDK NEW is another example of Brackets customer which does not provide appshell in its entirety.\r\n\r\nI propose to split inBrowser into three separate flags per each decision type that is being made:\r\n* accessing the file system operations (check for presence of brackets.fs)\r\n* opening native dialogs, such as Open, Save As dialog (check for presence of brackets.fs.showOpenDialog/showSaveDialog)\r\n* construction of HTML menus instead (check for presence of brackets.app menu ops)\r\n\r\nI\'ll be working on a PR for this, please let me know what you think meanwhile.'

See my last comment in that bug for more background on why the unit tests were only intermittently failing.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth reviewing each commit separately since they're all semantically independent (except for the last one, which requires the first three), although I think they're all worth fixing in the course of dealing with the unit tests. Here's a summary of each one:\r\n\r\n1. 9d8a24e: In the various places where we listen for `webkitAnimationEnd`, we weren't checking that the target of the event was actually the item we're listening to (because I didn't know that that event bubbles). This commit fixes that. (It unfortunately means we can't just use `$.one()` anymore because we only want to disconnect the event handler when we get the right target.) By itself, this would make it so that the existing Find/Replace tests would *consistently* fail (as they should have been, see (4) below), instead of only intermittently failing.\r\n2. c0b6510: This just adds a private parameter to the handler for `FILE_CLOSE` so that we can force a document to close even if it has dirty changes. This is useful for unit tests in a test window where we want to be able to manipulate a document but discard any changes we make before the next test.\r\n3. 86dc22c: This makes it so that the Find bar deliberately closes whenever the user switches documents. Currently, it *usually* closes, as a side-effect of focus changing when the document switches, but it doesn't close when the last document is closed. I mostly did this to support the changes to unit tests in (4), but I think it makes sense from a user point of view anyway.\r\n4. 450642b: This is the actual fix to the unit tests. Originally they ran in the test-runner window, but in that environment they don't get the real Brackets CSS. This was a problem because the Brackets CSS creates an animation for closing the modal bar, and the modal bar waits until that animation is complete before removing itself from the DOM. Because of the issues fixed by (1), however, we didn't always see this failure due to other transitions in the Bootstrap CSS in the test window. I could have hacked this somehow via a mock, but since the Find/Replace tests are really more UI integration tests than model tests, it made sense to me to have the existing tests run in a real Brackets test window anyway.\r\n\r\nNote that the new tests basically create a single window, and then repeatedly create new untitled documents to run the tests in. That's why I wanted to make the fixes in (2) and (3), and also changed one of the tests (which was assuming the file was color-coded). For that last issue, I could have just saved a JS file and tested against that, but it actually seemed cleaner to me to not have the tests depend on a particular color-coding.\r\n"

It is not causing other unit tests to fail, but is failing itself. Since it uses `WaitsForDone()` outside of any `it()` function, Jasmine does not know where to write errors, so they go to last test that was run.\r\n\r\n`removeTempDirectory()` needs to be synchronous because it is now run at the *beginning* of unit tests. When run at the *end* of unit tests, it might be more desirable to have an async version that reports errors to console.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I discovered is that `removeTempDirectory()` is only executed when running an all sets of tests in a suite. It would be nice if this could also be run when only running a single set of tests or only a single test. After more research I discovered that `removeTempDirectory()` *is* **synchronously** called for before and after any tests are run. But the **asynchronous** `runs()` blocks may or may not be run.

5084,'RaymondLim',"Make code hint insertion on tab key configurable\nAddresses #4963 by making the behavior of the `CodeHintList` on tab key events configurable on a global and per-`CodeHintProvider` basis. The `CodeHintManager` provider registration API is generalized with an additional optional property, `insertHintOnTab`, that indicates whether the `CodeHintManager` should request that the provider of the current session insert the currently selected hint on tab key events, or if instead a tab character should be inserted into the editor. If a provider omits this property, the behavior is determined by the `CodeHintManager`. The default behavior is to insert a tab character into the editor, as is the case now. The default can be changed globally with the new `CodeHintManager.setInsertHintOnTab(bool)` method. For an example use of this method, see my awesome new extension: [iwehrman/brackets-insert-hint-on-tab](https://github.com/iwehrman/brackets-insert-hint-on-tab).\r\n\r\nThis was @peterflynn's idea!"

See [Peter Flynn\'s comment](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/4265#issuecomment-23831957) for a good summary of the goal.\r\n\r\nLogically, the code was already doing most of what is desired (all except PeterF\'s last point). The problem was that keybinding being reported as an error was a generic (no platform specified) keybinding being temporarily inserted into the keybinding table (and would have correctly been removed in a subsequent pass), but unfortunately conflicted with the keybinding of another command.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I changed 2 things:\r\n\r\n1. Sort keybindings for command to insert platform-specific bindings first (which are never overridden), followed by the generic keybindings (which may be overridden). This prevents keybindings from being inserted which will later be removed. (Note might be able to cleanup some keybinding removal code here).\r\n\r\n2. Delay declaring an error until command-specific keybindings are checked for overrides.\r\n\r\nI also implemented **platform: "all"** as described in Peter\'s last point. Note that there are no cases in `keyboard.json` that require this, but it\'s required to fix a unit test.\r\n'

Also, like issues #4862 and #4778, this issue appears to be new with Sprint 30.  In Sprint 29, repetitive up/down arrow navigation is smooth in both cases.\r\n\r\nRepro Steps:\r\n1. Open src/editor/Editor.js in Brackets.\r\n2. Make sure Highlight Active Line is on.\r\n3. Goto line 1, then attempt to navigate to a higher line (say, 150 or 200) by holding down the down arrow key, causing repetitive down arrow key strokes.\r\n4. As a comparison, turn off the Highlight Active Line setting and repeat step 3.\r\n\r\nObserved Behavior:\r\nNavigation with Highlight Active Line on is much more jumpy than when Highlight Active Line is off.  It may not even be possible to accurate navigate to the higher line number in this manner.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nNavigation should be smooth in both cases.

There were two issues:\r\n\r\n* Originally, the instrumented HTML only needed to be parsed when the file changed on disk. Now we need to ensure that when a complete rethink is requested (which happens on browser reload or file save), the DOM is regenerated even if the file is just dirty in memory.\r\n* `generateInstrumentedHTML()` didn\'t used to be responsible for updating the marks in the editor, so the marks would be stale if its call to `scanDocument()` recreated the DOM. Now we make it refresh the marks as well.\r\n\r\nNote that this basically assumes that we want to do a full reparse of the DOM when the user saves the file or reloads in the browser. I think that\'s a good thing, because it gives the user an easy way to recover if they get into a bad state during incremental edits. If we didn\'t want to do that (and rely on the incrementally updated DOM when the browser reloads, for example), we could rejigger some of the logic here, but I like the idea of those two events forcing a "clean slate".'

4728,'dangoor','[LiveHTML] Make tokenizer more strict for attribute syntax\nFor #4713. @dangoor \r\n\r\nIn general, the tokenizer was already handling most cases of mismatched double-quotes correctly by returning an error. For example:\r\n\r\n`<p style="></p><img src="foo">`\r\n\r\nwas fine; the tokenizer would see the value of `style` as `"></p><img src="`, then try to parse `foo"` as an attribute name, and fail because `"` isn\'t legal in attribute names. (It actually should have failed for another reason--see below.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the case in #4713 was equivalent to:\r\n\r\n`<p style="></p><img src="foo/bar">`\r\n\r\nWhen the tokenizer saw the `/` while trying to parse `foo` as an attribute name, it assumed it was the beginning of a self-closing tag, and then just ate all the characters up until the `>`.\r\n\r\nI added three cases (following the HTML spec) where the tokenizer should be stricter in order to make it more likely to fail when there are mismatched attribute quotes:\r\n\r\n* in self-closing tag syntax, the `/` must immediately be followed with the \'>\', with no characters in between (not even whitespace)\r\n* a quoted attribute must be separated from the following attribute name (if there is one) by whitespace (this should have been the reason for the first case to fail)\r\n* there must be nothing in a close tag following the tag name besides whitespace (this isn\'t directly related to this case, but would make it even more likely that we would detect an error)\r\n\r\nThere are still cases where we could potentially get confused--for example, if there were an unclosed quote in an attribute value, the next quoted attribute value in the document happened to start with `>` or `/>`, and the rest of the tags around the mistake happened to balance out properly. This seems very unlikely, though, and I think there really isn\'t anything we can do about that since it could technically be a valid HTML document.'

(That might have been a contributing factor to #4682, but that was fixed by a different fix.)\r\n\r\nI tried adding some code to `_getMarkerAtDocumentPos()` that would skip marks whose tagID is no longer in `_cachedValues[editor.document.file.fullPath].dom.nodeMap`.

See for yourself here: http://jsbin.com/eyoful/1/edit - this "works" in FF 22, Safari 6.0.5 (7536.30.1) but hangs Chrome 30.0.1573.2 (a recent Chrome dev), and 30.0.1581.2 (latest Chrome dev ATM) & 30.0.1584.0 (Canary ATM).\r\n\r\nIt seems the regex is causing exponential backtracking, which v8 doesn\'t account for (at least this issue https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=430 mentioned it didn\'t in 2009 — while other browsers\' js engines will terminate after a number of backtracking steps has been reached, explaining why Safari and FF eventually end up finishing the regex execution) *but* should have been caught by the long running script behavior, and it seems some versions of Chrome versions fail to detect it. Chrome version 30.0.1573.2 doesn\'t show the unresponsive script dialog, and so the process hangs indefinitely, while the 30.0.1581.2 & 30.0.1584.0 were able to detect it in 99% of the cases. It seems still somewhat present in those later versions, as fiddling with hiding and showing the jsbin tab, after asking it to run, the Chrome used 100% CPU without being detected again.\r\nI don\'t know how/if CEF provides these hooks, but maybe their Chrome rev displays the same bug(s) as these Chrome versions which sometimes don\'t detect the long running js.\r\n\r\n2) Tried on build 20 as well, and since there is no hover preview there, it doesn\'t hang Brackets.\r\n\r\n3) Tried @gruehle\'s old hover preview extension gradient regex https://github.com/gruehle/HoverPreview/blob/master/main.js#L138 and this one doesn\'t hang (but of course is incomplete compared to the one in core right now)\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up: the regex is probably not safe, and there\'s probably also another Chrome bug in there preventing the regular safeguards from detecting the kind of cases where the regex is not safe.'

Might want to look at the diffs there to verify that my change makes sense (though since it's passing the unit tests I assume it's probably fine).\r\n* There was a unit test that was failing in the original ResearchLiveHTML branch. I tracked this down to the fact that `doFullAndIncrementalEdit()` wasn't resetting the mark state between the two tests. For most tests this is fine since the actual marks aren't affected by the edits, but in the case of adding a new tag, a new mark is generated, and it needs to be removed before doing the incremental version of the test.

Updated the JSlint directives to: `/*jslint vars: true, plusplus: true, devel: true, nomen: true, todo: true, unparam: true, indent: 4, maxerr: 50 */` on every file and added `regexp: true, forin: true, browser: true, node: true` after the maxerror directive when required in the file. The new things here are  `todo: true` to allow TODO comments and `unparam: true` to fix issues were one of the first parameter isn't used, but one of the last one is, for example, with event listeners. If JSLint would get updated to support this things, we could probably remove this directive.\r\n\r\n2. The rest of the fixes are:\r\n  a. Removed unused variables and some functions.\r\n  b. Fixed the use of else after a return or break.\r\n  c. Empty functions aren't allowed, but adding `return undefined;` keeps the same idea of an empty function.\r\n  d. Removed assignments inside the while guard.\r\n  e. Moved variables declared inside a loop outside of it.\r\n  f. Removed parenthesis around variables.\r\n  g. Removed some unused parameters.\r\n  h. Removed empty callbacks when using `brackets.fs.unlink` since is no optional.\r\n  i. Plus other minor changes.\r\n\r\nI tested and everything seems to work fine.

So, the slowdown was only about 7% on that particular file.\r\n\r\nThe median without the fix was 279ms vs. 300ms with the fix which is again about 7%.\r\n\r\n(1) it was actually 14 runs.

4502,'njx','Make sure an editor has focus before showing a ModalBar\nThis is a fix for #4287 and #3424\r\n\r\nIssue #4287 was caused by opening the "quick open" bar when the "find" bar was already open. Focusing the quick open bar blurs the find bar, causing it to close. When the find bar closes, it sets focus back to the editor, which blurs the quick open bar, causing _it_ to close. When this happens, the quick open bar is left in a semi-initialized state and leaves an orphaned smart autocomplete object in the DOM. \r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that an editor always has focus before a ModalBar is opened. If a non-editor (like another ModalBar) had focus, it has time to clean up before the ModalBar is opened.\r\n\r\nThis does _not_ fix #4500, but it does change the behavior.

4492,'peterflynn','[ARCH] Image preview draft\nHi! \r\n\r\nIt\'s not a final pull request, but I wanted to start a discussion about the feature. I\'ve implemented the image preview in Brackets, but I don\'t like the way it\'s currently done. That\'s how it works:\r\n\r\n* DocumentManager sends file path if it\'s an image instead of reading it as text;\r\n* Document has a "template" parameter which is supposed to point to a custom rendering method;\r\n* Editor _substitutes everything inside the CodeMirror wrapper for a custom template_ if the template name is set in the Document.\r\n\r\nNow, the emphasised part is something I strongly dislike, but I couldn\'t find a way around it. Opening an image as a document feels like a natural way of doing this (that\'s how it\'s done in Espresso.app, for example); opening a modal for image file types, while a viable alternative, feels inconsistent in terms of user experience and blocks the UI.\r\n\r\nAs for the current architecture, Brackets is strongly tied to CodeMirror and there is no way of consistently working with the document area without using at least the wrapper (which is understandable, Brackets being a text editor and all). It would be perfect to have not just an Editor class, but a Viewer class with custom templates (somewhat like I did it in this fork) as well, and an ability to switch between the two depending on a file type, but I\'m not familiar with Brackets well enough to even know if it\'s needed and supported by the core team, so I did what I did.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there\'s a few things I certainly need to do with this request before making it suitable for merging:\r\n* code conventions (really sorry for that one!)\r\n* template events (or at least a "before render" event for the status bar)\r\n* template files (right now there is a temporary and ugly workaround)\r\n* status bar (something has to be done instead of the hack in the current version, but I\'m not sure what)\r\n\r\nBut before doing all this I need to make sure somebody actually needs this, and maybe somebody from the core team could help out with Editor/Viewer (or at least discuss this in detail) and the status bar.\r\n\r\nThe ugly architecture aside, it works as intended on both platforms: shows an image preview and dimensions in the status bar. It could be a start, I guess.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nEd.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2013-07-17 at 8 07 57 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/145218/811825/f1caba38-eee1-11e2-8e99-5a7922bd0143.png)'

In particular, the now-saved file would be opened and added to the working set by the alternate code path, which wasn't forcing the working set list to be rebuilt when it was done.

I haven't done it, since the latest version is checking for new stuff, like unused parameters, unused variables, don't use an else branch after a return, TODO comments, etc. giving warnings in almost every file.

4421,'JeffryBooher',"INITIAL REVIEW: Animate inline editors open.\nMakes it so inline editors slide open and closed smoothly. Avoids various race conditions that can occur while inline editors are opening or closing.\r\n\r\nWhile this seems to be working well, there are a few things I'm not sure about.\r\n\r\n* In order for the animation to look smooth on retina, I force it to use the GPU by setting `transform: translateZ(0)` on the inline editor during the animation. However, that causes the entire window to flicker sometimes when an animation completes. The hack of setting `backface-visibility: hidden` on `body` appears to fix this. I don't *think* this causes the entire window to use the GPU (I don't see any performance issues with it set vs. unset), but we should verify that.\r\n* Because opening an inline editor now completes asynchronously, we return a promise that's resolved when the animation is done. The open animation is triggered by the inline editor calling `Editor.setInlineWidgetHeight()` once on its host editor. That's sort of weird from an API point of view--if the implementor of the inline editor doesn't know s/he needs to call this, the editor will never open and the promise will never resolve. I think it might already have been true that all inline editors needed to call this function even before adding the animation, so this isn't necessarily a new problem, but it does make me think we should clean up the API here--maybe requiring `onAdded()` to return a desired initial height?\r\n* The initialization lifecycle of inline editors isn't clear. There's the constructor, `load()`, and `onAdded()`. Both `load()` and `onAdded()` are theoretically part of the external API (they're stubbed in InlineWidget), but `load()` is only ever used by inline editor providers themselves immediately after calling the constructor; it's never called by Editor (only `onAdded()` is). On top of that, it seems like there was at least one bug where something that happens in `MultiRangeInlineEditor.load()` that used to work when everything was synchronous now needs to happen in `onAdded()` instead (though it's not clear why). I added a workaround for that specific case, but it seems like we need to be clear about what should happen at construction time (before being added to the DOM) vs. after being added.\r\n\r\nThe question in my mind for the last two is whether we should do those cleanups now, or have a larger inline editor architecture cleanup that would deal with some of the other architectural messiness we've had for awhile as well (like InlineTextEditor, which is a sort of vestigial subclass that no one uses directly).\r\n"
4420,'peterflynn','Potential saveAs() code cleanups\n* _doSaveAfterSaveDialog() doesn\'t correctly detect when the Save dialog is canceled (see #4417). Instead, it tries to write to the path "", and when that fails it rejects its promise.\r\n* The code first creates a blank file using the low-level fs.writeFile() API, then later fills in its contents via FileUtils.writeText().  I\'m not sure why -- writeText() ultimately just calls fs.writeFile() as well.  It seems like the first step could be eliminated.\r\n* We should avoid accessing raw brackets.fs APIs directly.\r\n* A document is explicitly created for the file before FileViewController.openAndSelectDocument() is invoked.  I don\'t think this is needed: the `newDoc` is created before the file\'s contents are written (since it\'s in between those two write steps), and since it isn\'t addRef()\'ed a second doc should get created later anyway, when openAndSelectDocument() triggers doOpen() (with the full file contents this time).\r\n* There are no error handlers for several steps: DocumentManager.getDocumentForPath(), FileUtils.writeText(), nor ProjectManager.refreshFileTree().  (It seems very unlikely for any of those to fail if the previous writeFile() succeeded, but for completeness we might want to add handlers).'

4404,'jasonsanjose','Brackets fails to startup in Sprint 27 with latest brackets-debugger and brackets-color-picker extension\nWith the brackets-debugger extension installed, Brackets will fail while loading extensions, failing to fire the APP_READY, causing the UI to appear "frozen" (project tree and editor don\'t load).\r\n\r\nThere are 2 fixes: (1) Fix ExtensionLoader to wrap module initialization in a try/catch block and (2) Update brackets-debugger to reference `Inspector.Console.clearMessages` in a callback function instead of at init time.\r\n\r\nbrackets-debugger and brackets-color-picker haven\'t been updated in a while, and has compatibility issues dating back to our CodeMirror v3 integration several sprints back.\r\n\r\nWORKAROUND:\r\n\r\n1. Force quit Brackets\r\n2. Delete brackets-debugger extension manually: Mac `~/Library/Application Support/Brackets/extensions/user/brackets-debugger` or Win `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Brackets\\extensions\\user\\brackets-debugger`\r\n3.

In a number of places I\'ve seen `message` contain formatted HTML content, so ideally we should allow the full gamut of formatting tags there.  For some reason, breaking this rule used to be less problematic, but somewhere in the recent Bootstrap/jQuery upgrade it started introducing a formatting glitch: a spurious top margin due to the containing `<p>` being automatically split in two.\r\n\r\nI think we could change the `<p>` to a `<div>` without breaking any of the dialog formatting.'

The main change is on line 843 where previously we called ``open()`` we now call ``_openInterstitialPage()``.\r\n\r\nThe symptom in the bug was due to calling ``loadAgents()`` twice. We never uninstalled the ``_onConnect`` handler when we relaunched chrome. So, instead of restarting the entire open workflow when we know we're going to relaunch, we just close and reopen the browser (now with debugging enabled) then open the interstitial page again.\r\n\r\nNote that on mac we still have the problem where the failed interstitial page tab is still open. Meaning, we get one tab with the correct live preview page and a 2nd tab with the interstitial page that will remain open, is harmless, but still slightly confusing. Unfortunately, we can't programatically close this extra page without a more invasive fix, either:\r\n\r\n* Set a timeout in the interstitial page to close after some time.

4317,'dangoor','[ResearchLiveHTML] Hooking up more edits and invalid/valid handling to the UI\nMight want to review the commits individually. The code gets worse and worse in later commits :) But most of the gross code is in RemoteAgent/HTMLDocument, and that stuff is all throwaway/easy to recreate more nicely.\r\n\r\nThe commit messages should be pretty self-explanatory. Here are a few notes:\r\n\r\n* With these changes, the UI should more or less handle all the various kinds of edits, with some caveats. Cases that work (at least in my limited testing on citrus completed):\r\n    * the things that worked before (modifying existing text, changing the src of an img attribute)\r\n    * deleting an entire text span at once\r\n    * copying an `<img>` tag and pasting it in another location\r\n    * editing the src attribute of the `<img>` tag that was just pasted\r\n    * deleting an `<img>` tag\r\n    * typing new attributes in a tag (see note below on valid/invalid states)\r\n* Cases that don\'t work well:\r\n    * typing an entirely new tag (see note below on valid/invalid states)--it gets confused as soon as you type a `<` before existing text. But if you paste something like `<img>` all at once, then type new attributes into it, it works.\r\n    * doing multiple (non-text) edits in a row--for example, pasting multiple images in. I pretty much have to close and reopen the connection in between each edit. Not clear whether this is in the differ or in the incremental update stuff.\r\n    * probably lots of other stuff :)\r\n* All of the unit tests are passing now (including incremental tests) except one (simple tag insertion), but that was failing before my changes as well (though with different symptoms). I think what\'s happening is that the edit list for tag insertion might not be technically incorrect, but is deleting and recreating a node that could just be left alone.\r\n* I didn\'t add tests for any of my new functionality. Sorry :)\r\n* I also fixed the bug you noted before (about old node map entries not getting deleted), and also did work to properly add/update marked ranges based on the new subtree. Note that the add/update marked range code is very inefficient because there\'s no quick way to find the mark for a given tag ID--we probably need to cache the marks somewhere.\r\n* The edit descriptors need some cleanup--there\'s some inconsistency between the various descriptor types in terms of usage of `parentID` vs. `tagID`, etc. Also, we should probably tune their structure towards what will make it easiest to do the update in the browser--right now some things are easier/harder to do based on the kinds of things that are available in jQuery (e.g. it\'s hard to select text nodes), which is part of the reason the RemoteAgent code I added is so terrible. If we switch to a pure DOM implementation on the backend, that will make other styles of update easier/harder.\r\n* To deal with valid/invalid states, I did basically what we talked about: made the parser (and everything upstream of it) return null if it detects a bad state anywhere; in that case, we don\'t do any updates until the next time the parser returns a valid DOM node, at which time we fall back to a full diff. After I added another case in the parser to detect when we seem to have unbalanced open/close tags, it now seems to catch cases of invalid attribute syntax pretty well. However, it doesn\'t detect the very common case where I just type "<" to start a new tag immediately before some text--the tokenizer doesn\'t seem to notice that eventually you run into another "<" without having closed off the first tag. That leads to some weird behavior where we create a new bogus tag and then don\'t recover from it later.\r\n* If I had time, the first thing I\'d do is rewrite the stuff I added to RemoteAgent to use a small library of manipulation functions on the browser side (instead of just eval-ing whole chunks of code all the time), and do any on-the-fly code gen that we need through Mustache templates. But I ran out of time :), and to the extent that it works it\'s probably not that important to clean it up right now.'

4315,'RaymondLim',"[HACK] [WHAT] [NO] Fix Mac command-key shortcuts in modal dialogs\nThis terrible, horrible no-good pull request fixes Mac command-key shortcuts (like cmd-D to dismiss the save dialog) in modal dialogs. The problem arises from the operating system capturing keyboard events that correspond to shortcuts for menu commands. The shell handles these keyboard events and translates them into command names,  which are translated into commands and executed at the JavaScript level. This hack intercepts these command names and, when a modal dialog is open, forwards them as `shellCommand` events which are handled by open modal dialogs. The `shellCommand` events are then translated into their corresponding key bindings (e.g., `edit.duplicate` --> `Cmd-D`), which are used to manufacture a corresponding `keydown` event, and which are immediately handed off to the modal dialog's `keydown` handler. \r\n\r\n(You may wonder why the command name forwarded from the shell isn't immediately translated into a keyboard event. To do so requires importing `KeyBindingManager` into `ShellAPI`, which seems to cause a circular dependency that makes Brackets sad.)\r\n\r\nSo, yes, this is very ugly, but, hey, YOU CAN DISMISS SAVE DIALOGS WITH THE KEYBOARD!

Currently this works only on a per-file basis, and the setting is not persisted.  (If we want it persisted, let me know.  Shouldn\'t be too difficult to do.)\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen a number of people requesting that certain file extensions be associated with certain syntax modes, and I myself started to get annoyed by having to modify `languages.json` in order to get syntax highlighting in a `.erb` file.  This pull request should remedy that by providing a simple enough way to override the language mode.\r\n\r\nTo switch the language for the current document, click the language name in the status bar and select a language from the dropdown in the dialog.  There\'s a reset button that will reset the language to the default for that particular file extension.\r\n\r\nNote that this also works for documents in inline editors.  If a document is open in a full editor and in an inline editor, both will be changed to the selected language.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be confused with the existing "Switch Language" dialog that allows you to change the language Brackets runs in for localization testing purposes.  I wasn\'t quite sure what to call this other than the "Switch Language" dialog.  I was thinking "Switch Language Mode" or "Switch Syntax Mode" might work, but I wasn\'t sure because technically modes and languages are two different things.  I\'m open to suggestions if anyone has an idea for how to name things better to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nNote that small additions to the APIs of Document and LanguageManager were required to support this new functionality.'

This was exacerbated by a recent commit to CodeMirror that increases the delay. We submitted a patch to CodeMirror that adds a "precise" parameter, which ensures that when `getTokenAt()` is called, it ignores cached line states that haven\'t been refreshed yet during the current highlighting pass. \r\n\r\nNote that this doesn\'t absolutely guarantee precision, since `getTokenAt()` will look backwards a maximum of 100 lines to find a line with a known good state; if it doesn\'t find one, it will pick the line with the least indentation and assume that it can use the mode\'s default start state at the beginning of that line. But it should be a good enough heuristic.\r\n\r\nAlso note that passing true for this parameter to `getTokenAt()` means that it will scan backward for a good line state farther than it originally did when run immediately after an edit. I think that performance tradeoff is fine for increased accuracy, and in most cases (like typing) it won\'t affect us that much because the last edit is on the current line.'

4173,'gruehle','Ignore key and close code hint session if code hint list is invisible\nFor #4172. \r\n\r\nThe issue is the long-standing one of dropdowns not notifying us when they close due to the user clicking out (because Bootstrap just takes the class off the dropdown--there\'s no notification mechanism). This basically just checks in the keydown handler if we\'re no longer visible, and if so ends the session.\r\n\r\nI\'m not absolutely certain of this fix (though it\'s better than nothing). The concern is that the original key handling code, which was in CodeHintManager, would check a couple of other things besides `CodeHintList.isOpen()` before deciding whether to dispatch a key. I *think* that in the case where the CodeHintList is actually handling the keydown, we only care about whether it\'s open.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think we need to clean up the control flow between CodeHintManager and CodeHintList...the fact that CodeHintManager knows about "sessions" but CodeHintList doesn\'t makes it hard to make the logic totally consistent here. Another symptom of this is that CHL can\'t just close itself, but calls a callback that is really just CodeHintManager\'s `_endSession()`. We should probably use events for that instead.'

4110,'gruehle',"REVIEW ONLY: Add ability to create multiple global key handlers\nThis is an alternate fix for #3975. It creates a more general mechanism for dealing with multiple global capture handlers for keydown.\r\n\r\nI think this is a cleaner fix than #4032, and it has the advantage that we can also use this same mechanism to simplify the nested-dialog key handling in Dialogs.js. However, it is somewhat more invasive (though I don't think it's necessarily more risky than #4032 if we can convince ourselves that the logic is correct).\r\n\r\nThe semantics of these new global keydown handlers is a bit tricky. The idea is that you can install multiple global keydown handlers, with the last-added one running first. Any of these handlers can return true in order to indicate that it handled the key. However, this does *not* have the same effect as the usual event `stopPropagation()`/`preventDefault()`; all it does is prevent the other global keydown handlers (including KeyBindingManager itself) from running. The desired intention is that this is the way modal/semi-modal key handling should work: only one modal should get to deal with the key, but it should be able to decide that the key should go through normal event handling (bypassing other modals further down the stack, including ordinary key bindings).\r\n\r\nAlso note that this introduces a subtle change in how keys are handled by code hints. It used to be that key events while the code hint list is up would come from CodeMirror, passed into CodeHintManager, and from there to the CodeHintList. Now, CodeHintList itself installs a global capture handler for the key events it cares about. I think this actually makes more sense, since the CodeHintList is basically a semi-modal UI, and should be trapping these key events directly, rather than relying on them coming from the editor.\r\n\r\nI tested various cases to try to verify that this is working properly:\r\n* the nested dialogs in ExtensionManager\r\n* code hints without Emmet installed--tested that up/down arrows, Enter and Esc work as expected while code hints are up, and after they're dismissed nothing unusual happens\r\n* code hints with Emmet installed--tested that this actually fixed the original bug :)\r\n\r\n"

This fixes [part 1](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/2015#issuecomment-10528269) of the 4-part list of issues there -- when dragging a panel to fill the whole UI, you can't overshoot and send the status bar (or other panels) sliding off the bottom of the window.  And it gives us a clean foundation to build the remaining fixes on.\r\n\r\nThis also enables a cleaner fix to #3371 -- see pull #3931 which is based on this branch.\r\n\r\nHere's what's changed:\r\n\r\n- PanelManager provides APIs to create panels below the editor area. JSLint\r\nand Find in Files now use these APIs.  (Find in Files panel UI is now moved out of main-view.html into a template).\r\n- Move editor-holder ht calculations from EditorManager to PanelManager\r\n- EditorManager listens to PanelManager for resize notifications. PanelManager\r\nlistens for window resize (moved from EditorManager) and for Resizer events\r\non all bottom panels. The old EditorManager.resizeEditor() API is still used\r\nfor edge cases such as status & search bar show/hide, extensions that add\r\nfixed top panels, and extensions that don't use Resizer APIs to hide/show\r\npanels.\r\n- Since PanelManager is listening, Resizer no longer pings EditorManager\r\ndirectly about show/hide/resize.  (This would let us use Resizer as a generic splitter widget in other parts of the UI if needed).\r\n- Resizer emits events to notify PanelManager about any panels it may have missed (legacy extensions that add panels via\r\nResizer instead of PanelManager).\r\n- Add max-size support to Resizer.  Change Resizer min/max limits to operate in terms of panel outer height.\r\n- PanelManager updates all bottom panels' max sizes when anything is resized/shown/hidden."

Can we make them the same size as the description text?\r\n* The description column seems very narrow--there's lots of extra room around it to the left and right.

This is a little odd, since it's neither proper URL-syntax (it's not URL-encoded and doesn't start with a slash) nor an actual native path (since it uses forward slashes). That said, it's convenient to work with, so we should clarify somewhere that all internal paths should be in this format on Windows.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like there's a function `FileUtils.convertToNativePath()`, which appears intended to take a URL-style path (`/C:/foo/bar/baz.txt`), URL-decode it, and strip off the leading slash if there is one.

Add font-family values that are directly defined by the CSS specification to `CSSProperties.json` so that the CSS hinter can provide font-family hints. This is useful because EWF might not be installed, might have failed to load, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Change the CodeHintManager API and implementation (:sunglasses:) so that CodeHintProviders can end the current session *and* request that the CodeHintManager immediately attempt to begin a new one by querying all the registered providers for hints. This is a non-breaking API change: providers may now return `true` to signal this in addition to all of their previous options, `null`, a hint object, or a deferred hint object, for which the semantics have not changed.\r\n\r\n3. Change the CSS hinter to request a session restart when it switches context from property names to property values. As a consequence, if you type `font-family:` then upon typing the `:` the provider returns `true`, hence requesting that the session be restarted. If a higher-priority provider is registered (like, e.g., EWF) then it can take over. Without this change, higher priority providers wouldn't get the opportunity to take over until the lower-priority provider ended the session because it either ran out of hints to provide (which is not the case here) or it inserted a hint (which also wouldn't happen here if the user typed out `font-family` in full).\r\n\r\nDiscuss!

The original "problem" there is that MultiRangeInlineEditor-test has a backtrack in it, whereas MultiRangeInlineEditor does not, so searching for "multir" results in a different sort of match between the two strings. (<b>Mult</b>iRange<b>I</b>nlineEditor vs. <b>MultiR</b>angeInlineEditor-test).\r\n\r\nLooking at this result, though, the "fix" (adjusting backtracking behavior to give the same result both times) would change both matches to be more like MultiRangeInlineEditor, when arguably they should be more like <b>MultiR</b>angeInlineEditor.\r\n\r\nMy fix should make the matching line up with scoring and user intent a bit better. If the user has already typed two characters in a row that match, the code now makes the assumption that the user may be trying to put a contiguous string together and tries that first. I think the results are generally better with this scheme.

(This isn\'t really a requirement for the installed extension list, but it was implemented for the registry list, which is currently turned off, and there didn\'t seem to be any reason to turn it off.)\r\n* User extensions can be removed by clicking the Remove button. \r\n* The Remove button is grayed out for "dev" extensions, with a tooltip explaining why.\r\n* After removing extensions, closing the dialog will prompt the user to quit Brackets.\r\n* The original Install Extensions dialog is available from the "Install from URL..." button at the bottom left of the Extension Manager dialog.\r\n\r\nNotes on the implementation:\r\n* `ExtensionManager` is now responsible for both accessing the remote registry and keeping track of installed extensions. The `extensions` object maps extension ids (or paths for local legacy extensions with no id) to a bundle of info about the associated extension, both info about it from the registry and info from the local installation (which might be different).\r\n* `ExtensionManagerDialog` is the main entry point into the dialog, but it pretty much just creates an `ExtensionManagerView`. (The search box is in the dialog class just because that\'s where it makes sense to have it in the layout, but it\'s really hooked up into the view.)\r\n* `ExtensionManagerView` is the main listing. It now has two modes: you can either view the registry (which isn\'t currently enabled in the build) or the list of locally installed extensions.\r\n* `ExtensionManagerViewModel` keeps track of the current filtered list of extensions in the view, and notifies the view when the status of an extension has changed due to installation or removal. (This model class is separate from the main ExtensionManager since it\'s really keeping the state of the dialog view--it\'s not intended to be more generally useful than that.)\r\n\r\nI\'m still not 100% happy with the refactoring here, since the View class doesn\'t talk directly to the ExtensionManager for things like data and status changes (those are mediated through the model), but does still talk to ExtensionManager to actually remove extensions. (Also, since installation is still reliant on the old installation dialog, it also talks to that directly rather than going through ExtensionManager for installation.) Suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n'
3792,'jasonsanjose','Slow page reload (5s) if the main editor does not show the main file\n5s is the static server extension\'s default timeout when it waits for Brackets to handle a "request" event. The HTML instrumentation is apparently only responding when the HTML file is the main file open in Brackets. The code responsible is in LiveDevelopment.js - the request handler is registered in `_openDocument` and unregistered in `_closeDocument`. These methods are called when switching to or from a live dev file.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the page continues to work even after the live development session has been closed again (it may still be open in the browser). However, then HTML instrumentation is no longer needed, so the node server could just serve the files directly. For that, we need to undo the call to `_serverProvider.setRequestFilterPaths` in `_openDocument`. There does not seem to be an API for that (i.e. `removeRequestFilterPaths`).\r\n\r\nWhile live development is still active, a reload should always trigger HTML instrumentation, I think. Maybe it is only needed when the HTML file is the active file - but if a reload when saving an included LESS file disables HTML instrumentation, another reload to enable it is required when switching back to the HTML file.'

The model still relies on the Extension Manager to do the actual fetching of the registry from the server.\r\n* I didn't break the view model out as a separate file since it's really specific to the view--no one else should need to know much about it. Of course, I already broke that rule since the dialog knows about it :), but I think of the dialog as just a thin shell around the view. I'm happy to break the model out into a separate file if it's appropriate.\r\n* I also didn't add unit tests for the dialog since the filtering functionality is tested on the model.\r\n* This just does a full linear search on each keystroke. I added a task to the Trello card to stress-test this with a reasonable number of extensions. If it turns out to be slow, we can back it down to do the search on Enter instead.\r\n* This doesn't highlight the found search string in each item. I wasn't clear on whether this was part of the criteria--need to check with @adrocknaphobia.\r\n* The search box is actually in the outer dialog, not the view itself, just because it seemed to make more sense there in the current design. Once we get the final XD design, it's easy to move it wherever it needs to be, since it just calls a filter function on the view's model."

Garth says no, but I'm not as sure (see next issue)\r\n[redmunds] quiet-scrollbars now display on focus, but this only works for content tall enough to scroll.\r\n\r\n3) What happens when you click inside the widget but outside the scrollable part of it?  Right now, focus goes to some weird part of the host editor's CM wrapper, where pressing the arrows actually scrolls the host editor but typing letters doesn't edit the host editor. Tthat seems bad, except that afaict you can't make the text there selectable without allowing it to take focus, so I'm not sure what the right answer is there. we could let it take focus, but then capture arrow keys & pipe them over to the scrollable part of the docs or something... but that seems hard to get right\r\n[redmunds] Focus is not in a usable place, but nothing bad seems to happen. Easy to change focus with mouse. Only way to change focus with keyboard is using Ctrl-K (but have to hit it twice).\r\n\r\n4) Is there a gesture to jump focus in & out of the inline widget?  we've talked about doing this for inline editors, but it seems even more useful here -- especially if it steals focus by default (because you'll often want to type in the code while looking at the docs, Esc to close isn't a good enough way to resolve this)\r\n\r\n5) should scrolling with arrow keys momentarily make the quiet scrollbars visible?  that's how Lion scrollbars work, but currently our quiet scrollbars don't do that.  it could make scrolling with arrow keys feel confusing\r\n[redmunds] quiet-scrollbars now display on focus\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The current layout is more or less copied from the web app; this will change once we have the XD design.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n* The dialog is factored into Dialog, View, and Model. This might seem overly factored, but my assumption is that we might want to host the extension listing in something other than a dialog eventually, so I wanted to keep the Dialog part as just a thin shell around the View, and have the View contain all the real functionality. The Model is also really simple right now, but I expect that over time we\'ll add filtering as well as interaction with the underlying extensions and installation functionality to the model.\r\n* I went with "Mgr" instead of "Manager" just to avoid ReallyLongManagerNames. This is inconsistent with our other files, though, so I\'m open to changing it.\r\n* The template for the view isn\'t localized yet because I wanted to wait until we have the final design before doing so (since most of the strings to localize are little connectives like "by" and "on" that might not even be there in the final design).\r\n* I created a SpecRunnerUtils method to create a mock container element that\'s offscreen, but ended up not using it.

3365,'redmunds',"Correct fix for gutter padding issue in #3211\nThe original fix in #3212 (overriding a style change made in CodeMirror) was a temporary measure until we figured out the real problem. It turns out that the issue is that we were setting vertical `padding` on both `.CodeMirror-lines` and `.CodeMirror-gutters` (since we want a little space at the top of the code area). I think the gutter padding used to be necessary in v2 because the line numbers were actually separate, but now that the line numbers are laid out as part of the lines themselves, it seems like we're only supposed to have it on `.CodeMirror-lines`. (I'm confirming this with Marijn, but it seems correct just looking at how the DOM is structured now.)\r\n\r\n(Also, it was probably wrong for this padding to be on `.CodeMirror-gutters` to begin with--it was probably on `.CodeMirror-gutter` in v2, but it was in a block of styles that ended up needing to be on `.CodeMirror-gutters` instead, so it just got moved along with them.)\r\n\r\nThe line numbers still seem to line up properly, and the original bug no longer reproduces for me with this change."

3347,'jasonsanjose',"Don't execute menu commands if we're at a breakpoint\nThis pull request contains a horrible, horrible hack. I am ashamed to have written this code. There must be a better way to do this, but I haven't been able to find it. Please think twice (or more) before merging this request... \r\n\r\nHere is the scenario: you're hacking away on Brackets and need to hunt down a bug in the Brackets code. You open the Dev Tools, browse through the scripts, and set a breakpoint. Your breakpoint is hit. Life is good. While still at the breakpoint, you go back to Brackets and select a menu item (or press a menu shortcut). The command is executed. WTF? I thought I was at a breakpoint!?!? Well, guess what, you _were_ at a breakpoint, and the menu command was executed anyway. As you can imagine, this could lead to Very Bad Things.\r\n\r\nOn to the hack... I could not find a reliable way to determine if Brackets was being debugged, and at a breakpoint. The only possible solution I could think of is to look at the stack at the time `ShellAPI.executeCommand()` is called. Under normal circumstances, this is the _only_ call on the call stack. If you are at a breakpoint, I noticed that all of the code up to the breakpoint is _also_ included on the stack. Read the code to see the hack. \r\n\r\nExcuse me while I hide my head in shame."

The dialog template was used just for the content and only in Find in Files, but it could be used for all the find templates with few modifications.

It could still be increased, but haven't checked what would be right max. (Implemented in #4303)\r\n\r\n- [x] Double clicking on a result now adds it to the working set.

(Implemented in #4729)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added a new command to search only the files in the working set, and changed the scope functions to work with multiple files, so if we add a multiple file selection, a new search method could be easily added.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Added 2 new commands to select the previous/next row in the search result table.

I tested a bit just moving the search, but wasn't able to do it yet using Transferable Objects (without those, brackets crashes and wouldn't make a good optimization).

3049,'iwehrman',"JS hinting is broken inside of HTML script tags\nAs pointed out by @cfjedimaster, the JavaScript hinter does not handle inline JavaScript within HTML well at all. It should probably be disabled for files that aren't pure JS. There are a number of related problems: \r\n\r\n1) The hinter assumes incorrectly that its Session object will be initialized before the CodeHintManager calls into it. It assumes this because the Session object is initialized when the active editor changes, but only if the mode of the selection is JavaScript. If the editor is made active with the cursor outside of a script tag then the Session won't be initialized. If the cursor is then moved inside the script tag, the CodeHintManager will ask the hinter for hints, which causes errors due to the uninitialized Session object.\r\n\r\n2) If instead the Session is correctly initialized (because, e.g., the editor is made active with the cursor inside a script tag), the hinter still doesn't work correctly because it attempts to parse the entire HTML file and not just the script body. Because parsing always fails, the hinter always returns a deferred hint list to the CodeHintManager that never resolves.\r\n\r\n3) Even more egregious is that if a Session object has already been correctly initialized for a JavaScript file before switching to an HTML file with the cursor outside of the script tag, then the previous Session reference will be incorrectly reused once the cursor is moved back inside the script tags. This causes the hinter to return nonsensical results based on the wrong file. (Ugh, who wrote this code?)"

This bug occurs with any blur handlers that call EditorManager.focusEditor(), since that can cause such re-entrant focus attempts (with two different editors).\r\n\r\nBlur handlers run synchronously while an editor is in the middle of getting focus, so the state is a little funny - activeEditor hasn't been updated yet (blur fires before focus), so focusEditor() tries to focus the old Editor that's in the process of losing focus. Webkit seems to ignore tht attempt; but CodeMirror assumes that programmatic focus requests always\r\nsucceed, so CodeMirror's state.focused flag becomes wrong. This has a delayed effect the NEXT time that editor gains focus: it doesn't dispatch a focus event since CM thought it already had focus; as a result, activeEditor never updates and any code that uses activeEditor gets the wrong value.\r\n\r\nI think we could fix this by triggering stuff on focusIn instead of blur (which is how ModalBar works and why the Find bar doesn't have a similar bug). But it seems safer just to cut it off at the root: re-entrant attempts to focus Editors."

The branch was landed before some smaller issues were addressed to give it additional bake time.\r\n\r\nRemaining issues:\r\n1. @jasonsanjose and both felt that mode shouldn\'t be optional when calling defineLanguage().  It seems virtually guaranteed to be a bug in the extension, so best to fail loudly instead of silently.  To handle the rare case where a developer wants to add limited language support before code coloring is available, the developer could just explicitly specify "text/plain" as the mode.  (See [this comment](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/2844#discussion_r3075050) and to some degree [this one](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/2844#discussion_r3125153))\r\n2. Language\'s constructor allows `id` to contain "." but not "_", the opposite of the docs.  Though I actually like "." better since it\'s more consistent with our other id naming conventions, and I don\'t really see the need for explicit restrictions anyway... (See [this comment](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/2844#discussion_r3147001)).\r\n3. Language._addFileExtension() may want to check for a "." in the string since it\'d be an easy mistake to make.  Or we could handle both like getLanguageForFileExtension() does.\r\n4. The iteration over _defaultLanguagesJSON should use CollectionUtils.forEach() instead of $.each() -- we\'ve been moving away from $.each() because it\'s buggy if arbitrary string keys are possible.\r\n5. I think Language._setMode() can just use Array.isArray() instead of $.isArray()\r\n6. The way LanguageManager sets its exports at the end doesn\'t match our usual format\r\n7. Docs on the `defineMIME("text/x-brackets-html"...` call could use clarification (see [this comment](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/2844#discussion_r3147194))\r\n8. Language doesn\'t have JSDocs (or a prototype declaration) for these fields: mode, blockComment, lineComment, _fileExtensions, _modeToLanguageMap, _modeReady\r\n    * Should blockComment, lineComment be private though?  They have a setter you\'re supposed to use...\r\n9. JSDocs in Editor still reference Languages instead of LanguageManager\r\n10.

But there was another bit of code in `isWelcomeProjectPath()` that was accessing the welcome folder array and pushing the current welcome path onto it temporarily, just for the purposes of including it in the list so that the `indexOf()` on the next line would also check it. This seemed safe (although not really all that smart anyway) since we didn't call `setValue()` again. However, it turns out that array/object values returned from the `PreferenceStorage` are actually live objects cached in the preference structure, so if you modify them, the new values will eventually get saved out even without an explicit `setValue()`. Not sure if this is a bug or a feature.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the fix is simple (don't push the extra value on, just check it separately).

For each color editor, we create a unique origin string. This makes it so that all consecutive edits from a given color editor are batched into a single undo. This is slightly different from our v2 behavior, where the edits would only be batched if they were close together in time. We could implement that heuristic instead, but batching all edits from a given editor together seems to make sense as well, and is more predictable. (Of course, if there are intervening edits elsewhere in the document, they will interrupt the undo batching, as you would expect.)\r\n\r\nNote that the change to `Editor._applyChanges()` isn\'t actually necessary for this bug fix and probably won\'t have any effect in the codebase today, but it seems to make sense semantically (i.e., if undos are batched in the underlying document, they should be batched in the synchronized editor, and vice versa).

2560,'dangoor','If you hit Cmd-F while search bar is already open, just select existing query\n@peterflynn \r\n\r\nFor #2478, I think the expected behavior from the user\'s point of view should be that focus stays in the Find bar and the current query text is selected.\r\n\r\nThe main bug was that when creating a new modal bar, the old one would autoclose itself (because it would lose focus), but there was a timing issue where a focus change would get sent out and the new modal bar would also autoclose itself. The old CodeMirror "dialog" handled this by adding a timeout within which it would ignore focus changes, but that seemed like a big hack and I didn\'t want to reinstate it. So, we simply always close the modal bar explicitly before creating a new one; and if you start a new search while the old one is open, we just copy over the query from the old one instead of using the selected text (which might differ in capitalization from the old query).\r\n\r\nI tried a more straightforward fix--instead of closing and reopening the modal bar in this case, just set focus to the existing one. But skipping over the "new modal bar" logic in `doSearch()` led to other weird behavior, like the search cursor position not getting reset to the current cursor position. Rather than try to refactor all that logic and possibly break other cases, I decided to try to use the existing logic as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we need to really clean up how all this stuff works and get rid of the last vestiges of the old CodeMirror approach. (I had started this in my "unified find/replace" branch--in that branch, we don\'t need to open and close the modal bar so much.)'

But ultimately, it didn't seem worth it for this fix because it wouldn't avoid most of the thorny issues:\r\n* Processing letter keys async _after_ the key event is a must if we want to avoid performance problems from multiple key events queueing up (the staleness check in _filterCallback() won't work otherwise).  So the async complexity there wouldn't be avoided.\r\n* Earlier I griped about Smart Autocomplete not noticing programmatic text field changes, which we'd had to work around in an earlier bug.  But it turns out that's basically impossible to fix since programmatic changes don't dispatch any events.\r\n\r\nDown the road we still may want to get rid of it: it would still make key handling a _tad_ cleaner (e.g. simplifying the Enter key fix here), let us improve perf _slightly_ more (by skipping list re-render when stale instead of only skipping re-filtering as here), let us fix memory leak #1550, and fix the odd bug where hitting right-arrow is treated as hitting Enter.

This pull request ensures that `lastChar` is reset after failing to start a session. \r\n\r\nIn more detail, assume the letter 'a' is typed in some editor context. `lastChar` is set to 'a' in `handleKeyEvent`, and later `handleChange` calls `_beginSession` because `lastChar` is now truthy.

The return key event causes an editor change and so `handleChange` is called, which again calls `_beginSession` because `lastChar` remains truthy from the last keypress. This request for an implicit hinting session is spurious. "

There seemed to be something in the regular expression for the offset-parsing that was trying to detect a backslash before the `{{`, but I don't think that was actually being used, since the code that matches the regular expression would only ever call it when the current index was already at the beginning of a `{{`. Removing this didn't seem to break any of the existing tests; if we do want a way to backslashify the offset braces, we'll need to implement it some other way."
2375,'redmunds',"getInfoFromPos(): rgba() type values are split in an odd way\nAccording to the spec for `CSSUtils.getInfoFromPos()`, `rgba()`-type property values are split into individual tokens, with the assumption that the caller will be responsible for figuring out how to sew it back together into a single semantic value. However, the values array that is generated doesn't seem to give the right information. For example, `rgba(50, 100, 200, 0.3)` gets split into `['rgba, ', '100, ', '200, ', '0.3']` if the cursor is at the beginning of the value, and gets split into `['rgba', '(50, ', '100, ', '200, ', '0.3']` if the cursor is at the beginning of `100`. I would expect that the set of tokens should be stable no matter where the cursor is, and that it should always concatenate to the original string."

But the Replace dialog is never dismissed, so you can't specify the string to replace it with. Only option is to hit Esc to cancel.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in KeyBindingManager().

I thougth it would make more sense, and avoids dependencies with `NativeFileSystem` when only wanting to check  error name values.\n- `_nativeToFileError` has been modified to just convert a brackets.fs error code to a NativeFileError error name. Hopefully this clears out any confusion in NativeFileSystem by making explicit all the error constructors in the same way.\n- `DOMError` has a `name` attribute where `FileError` had `code`.\n\n__Notes__\n- There's no longer a dependency with the browser implementation of `FileError`, nor the need to use a polyfill for the in-browser branch.\n- Errors that don't have a custom message are more descriptive when printed on dialog errors (i.e. instead of showing _error.4_ you now see something like _error.

2314,'gruehle',"Move Find dialog out of editor\nFor #2095, this moves the Find bar out of the editor and into the toolbar. The visual appearance is similar to what we have today, and the functional behavior should be the same. The main difference is that the Find bar no longer overlaps the editor content, so if a found item scrolls to the top of the viewport, it's no longer hidden by the Find bar. Find in Files and Quick Open were changed to use the same implementation.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I replaced the dialog.js implementation we were using from CodeMirror with a new class, ModalBar, that mimics the same functionality but does not create the bar inside the CodeMirror wrapper element. If ModalBar is constructed with `autoClose` set to `true`, it mimics the CodeMirror dialog.js functionality of closing the dialog on Return and Esc keys and blur events, but dispatches its own events for those cases instead of calling a callback. Find/Replace uses this functionality, whereas Find in Files and Quick Open don't.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever the ModalBar appears or disappears, it attempts to preserve the apparent scroll position in the editor, so the code doesn't shift around. The only case where it can't do this is if the editor is scrolled all the way to the top while the ModalBar is open--in that case, of course, it's not possible to keep the code in the same place; it has to shift back up.\r\n\r\nNote that there are a couple of bugs I know about in this implementation (which is why it's just up for initial review):\r\n\r\n* When the Quick Open bar closes, the code shifts upward. I'm pretty sure this is because of the hack we're doing when closing the bar (see the comment online #380); removing the raw DOM node makes it so `ModalBar.close()` can't figure out how much to scroll back up (since it needs to measure its current height, and that height will be 0 if the DOM node has already been removed). I can think of some workarounds, but want to consult with @peterflynn about the hack first.\r\n* When an invalid regexp is entered, the parse error message shows up as before, pushing the editor downward and causing the status bar to disappear. I could add code to fix this, but want to think about alternatives for showing the error state.\r\n\r\nIn a separate branch, I actually have a much more radical replacement for Find/Replace that unifies them into a single modal bar and eliminates a good deal of the messy code (and simplifies ModalBar as well), getting closer to the Find/Replace design that's in the original Northstar. It has one bug I'm having trouble figuring out, but if I can get that figured out, we might want to go ahead and just go straight to that version. I'll consult with some folks before putting up that pull request though."

The one exception is `close()`, which\n  is a bit weird right now.\n* Changed the incorrect way we were using the `parentClass` pattern for supers--we were calling\n  `this.parentClass.myMethod.call(this)`, which doesn't work if the current method being called is on an\n  intermediate class in the inheritance chain. Instead, it should be `MySubclass.prototype.parentClass.myMethod.call(this)`.\n* In InlineColorEditor, eliminated the `this.editor` property in favor of using the `this.hostEditor` set up by the \n  `InlineWidget.load()` method.\n\nThe issue with `close()` is that the base version in InlineWidget seems to assume that there is an `_editorHasFocus()` method on `this`, but InlineWidget doesn't actually define one. Need to figure out if this should be given a default implementation that just returns `true`. If so, then we could just eliminate `close()` from InlineImageWidget, and the dummy `_editorHasFocus()` implementation on InlineColorEditor."

2258,'joelrbrandt','Code hints are sometimes displayed when they shouldn\'t be\nBig thanks to @iwehrman for helping understand and suggest solutions for this bug.\n\nCode hints are sometimes displayed when they shouldn\'t be. For example, with the [EWF](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-edge-web-fonts) extension installed, FontHints are sometimes displayed in CSS files when the extension doesn\'t intend for this to happen. \n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n0. Install [EWF](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-edge-web-fonts) extension and open a CSS file with a font-family rule.\n1. Put cursor at the end of a font name, but before a comma.\n2. Press space.\n\n**Expected:**\nList doesn\'t show up\n\n**Actual:**\nList shows up.\n\n**Cause:**\nThe problem seems to be related to the decoupling of all steps in the code hint process (shouldShowHintsOnKey, getQueryInfo, and search functions that providers implement)\n\nIn this case, the AttrHints provider (which is supposed to provide attribute hints for HTML) says it will provide hints on a "space" key. Then, CodeHintManager asks every single provider for query info. AttrHints returns nothing (which is correct) but FontHint can offer hints (and doesn\'t know space was typed) so it does. This causes the hint list to appear.\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n1. CodeHintManager could pass context (e.g. editor, mode) to providers when calling "shouldShowHintsOnKey" so they can make a better decision.\n\n2. CodeHintManager could only call getQueryInfo on providers that said yes to "shouldShowHintsOnKey"\n\n3. Providers could be registered on a per-mode basis and then shouldShowHintsOnKey would only get called for providers that are registered for the current mode (related to #1 / may lessen the need for #1)\n\n4. possible that "shouldShowHintsOnKey" should be renamed to something like "wantToProvideHintsOnKey" to make its intent more clear to implementers of providers.\n\n**Other suggestions:**\n\n1. Right now, multiple hint providers can say they want to show hints, but only one (first one registered to return query info) ends up providing hints. This means that it\'s impossible to build extension that override our built in providers. Could fix by making it the case that there\'s only one (or zero) provider per mode. But then we\'d need to merge all of the HTML providers into one.\n\n2. Division of labor between "getQueryInfo" and "search" seems strange because it seems to be the case that getQueryInfo and search are always called as a pair (once a provider is chosen). Instead, it might make sense to have one function that gets called the first time (i.e. when selecting a provider and displaying the list for the first time) and one function that gets called each time the user types (i.e. updates the query/filters the list).\n'

We knew this was going to be cumbersome, but wanted to wait and see whether it was important for it to be quickly accessible.\n\nAfter scenario testing for a bit, I think we really do want a more convenient shortcut for turning it on and off, because I expect people to want to do it frequently:\n\n* When working in a CSS file, even a relatively simple one, I really wanted to have the highlighting on most of the time as I was navigating around the file, because it showed me instantly whether or not I was working on the rule I wanted to be working on.\n* But while actually editing a rule, especially using something like the new color picker, I really wanted it off temporarily so I could see what my edits were doing. This wasn't true for all edits--in fact, for editing width/height, I actually wanted to keep the highlighting on so that I could see the border easily for elements that didn't themselves have a strong border.\n\nThese two factors suggest to me that we won't be able to come up with a good heuristic for automatically turning off highlighting during edits, and that instead we should just make it really really easy for users to turn it on and off.\n\nI'm even tempted to say we should use one of the precious single-key shortcuts, of which Cmd-B or Cmd-U would be available (though not mnemonic). However, even having a Cmd-Shift shortcut, like Cmd-Shift-L, would be preferable to the Vulcan nerve pinch we have now :)"

2198,'gruehle','Create files on collapsed folders (#2085)\nThis is a possible fix for #2085 by waiting on the `open_node.jstree` event before trying to create a new node.\n\nIt looks like we\'re hitting a strange race condition in `jsquery.jstree.js` which appears when the node we want to open hasn\'t been loaded yet.\n\nIn that case, `open_node` triggers a `load_node` in line 640.\n\n```javascript\n632\t open_node\t: function (obj, callback, skip_animation) {\n\t     [...]\n638\t\t if(!this._is_loaded(obj)) {\n639\t\t\t obj.children("a").addClass("jstree-loading");\n640\t\t\t this.load_node(obj, function () { t.open_node(obj, callback, skip_animation); }, callback);\n641\t\t }\n```\n\nAlmost at the same time, a different `load_node` is triggered from the CRRM `create` through  `create_node` in line 734\n```javascript\n726\t create_node\t: function (obj, position, js, callback, is_loaded) {\n\t     [...]\n733\t\t if(obj !== -1 && !obj.length) { return false; }\n734\t\t if(!is_loaded && !this._is_loaded(obj)) { this.load_node(obj, function () { this.create_node(obj, position, js, callback, true); }); return false; }\n735\n736\t\t this.__rollback();\n```\n\nNot digging much further, if the second `load_node` gets called because the first one is not completed, then `create_node` is not called again as expected and nothing gets created. This can be tested by adding a breakpoint in line 733. Doing that, the first `load_node` always finishes and the function completes ok.\n\nBy waiting to the `open_node` event, we\'re making sure we always step into `create_node` once the node is already loaded.\n\n__UPDATE__ Just to confirm, the `load_node_json` call just returns without doing nothing if the node is already being loaded, which causes the callback to `create_node` to get dropped without ever being called. Also, this check seems to have been removed in the v1.0 branch (https://github.com/vakata/jstree/blob/v.1.0/src/jstree.json.js)'

Making an edit after undoing kills redo.\n\nSome caveats:\n* This is hardcoded to Ctrl/Cmd-Z for undo and Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-Z and Ctrl/Cmd-Y for redo. Eventually, we need a more general way to do contextual keybindings for pieces of UI like this (where it doesn't make sense to create an app-global command).\n* It might have been a little better to just pass undos/redos through to CodeMirror, but in our current inline editor implementation those undos actually cause the editor to collapse, since they destroy the underlying bookmark that tracks the position of the editor. This could be a viable option in v3, but changes to the way undos are batched there will probably mean that we'd need to request an API for control over undo batching across separate real edits.\n* Eventually, we should have a more sophisticated multi-step undo system for inline editors like this that tries to be smart about when we record undos and integrates properly with the CodeMirror undo system."

In this cases if the start or end of the selection is inside a line-comment it will try to do a line uncomment if all the lines in the selection are line-commented and will do nothing if at least one line is not line-commented. It might be missing the alternative, using a line-comment command to uncomment a block-comment when possible, but wasn't sure if this was wanted.\r\n\r\nNote that some block comment could not actually create a comment, like commenting inside a string or a line comment (in cases the first and last lines are commented but one in the middle isn't), and in other cases it could break other comments.

It would be cleaner if we load all extensions first, then load the initial project.  But that runs afoul of #968 -- a problem loading extensions would prevent Brackets from loading the initial project, which at least in the past left it pretty much hosed.

Once a test run is complete, you can get this results object and call `toJSON()` on it to get summarized output. See the comment on the TopLevelResults constructor for the details of the `suites` property, which is what gets serialized to the JSON output.\r\n\r\nOriginally I was thinking I would create a third reporter that would run by itself (separately from the Bootstrap and Performance reporters) when in automated test mode. However, I decided that it wasn't really worth refactoring more logic out of the Performance reporter to create a separate reporter that can run headless, because we have to run with the test window, etc. anyway. So rather than creating a separate reporter, I just have the existing reporters push their data into the results object. In retrospect, it might not even have been necessary to factor out the results object itself, but it does seem a little cleaner to have it be separate (and referenced by the two reporters) rather than just having its data mixed into the BootstrapReporter's UI data as it is today (and having the PerformanceReporter call the BootstrapReporter to add perf information)."

1860,'DennisKehrig','focusedEditorChange event fires incorrectly in some cases\nFiled as new issues from the fix for #1257\r\n\r\n- When I start Brackets and then open a file by clicking on its name in the project tree, I get TWO identical focusedEditorChange events. I expected one.\r\n- Switching to a different file in the same manner again results in two identical events. While the second parameter (the first being the event) correctly points to the new editor, the third parameter is `null`, as if no file had been open before. I expected the third parameter to refer to the previous editor. If that is not possible for some reason, maybe a "editorFocusChange" event makes more sense, one parameter being the editor in question, the other being whether it gained (true) or lost (false) focus. Or two separate events.\r\n- Switching to a different window, then switching back to Brackets triggers another editorFocusChange event, the third parameter being `undefined` instead of `null` this time (I suggest using `null` consistently). However, I would not expect this event at all (at least not without a counterpart indicating that the focus has been lost when switching to a different window). If it is sent only once, I\'d expect the third parameter to be identical to the second.\r\n- When changing focus back and forth between a full editor and an inline editor (or between different inline editors) by clicking on parts of the content, the third parameter is always `undefined`. I expected it to point to the editor that had focus before.\r\n- When switching from one entry in an inline editor to another via its selector, the third parameter is `null`'

Test data from Alex's original proof-of-concept patch suggest this change may improve typing performance by 1/3 and nearly double scrolling framerate!\r\n\r\nSo, the two wrinkles with this are:\r\n\r\n**Vertical layout**\r\nWithout flexbox, you'd typically have to do the equivalent vertical layout programmatically with JS -- which is no problem in this case since CodeMirror needs to get a JS call anyway each time the editor's height changes.  So all that's really needed is code to calculate the desired editor height, since we can't just measure its flex container any more.\r\n\r\n**Horizontal layout**\r\nThe horizontal layout of the sidebar + content area (the vertical toolbar/editor/panels stack) used to use a horizontal flexbox.  It now uses 'float: left' for the sidebar and an equivalent margin on the content stack.  The margin is needed since non-floated boxes actually underlap their floated siblings (only the flowed content inside them is actually pushed inward).  This would have caused several problems: CodeMirror's mouse handling blocked the sidebar, and 'position: relative' items like the toolbar would have drawn on top of the sidebar."

Calling this API forces the creation of the _masterEditor for the document, which violated an assumption in the unit tests that the master editor for a document wouldn't be created immediately on opening an inline editor for that document. The user-visible effect of this change is to make it so that the cost of creating the backing _masterEditor moves to the point where you open the inline editor, rather than waiting until you actually make an edit. Arguably a minor change, but it seemed best not to change the behavior.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to factor the logic for calculating the column position into Editor, and having that code call _codeMirror directly to get the range text."

The main account (David) had previously run Brackets Live Preview without problem.

Here are a couple of error messages found in C:\\Users\\V2B\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\debug.log after trying to use Live Preview in the David account:\n\n[0926/230000:ERROR:client_util.cc(394)] Failed to load Chrome DLL from C:\\Users\\V2B\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\22.0.1229.79\\chrome.dll\n[0926/230000:ERROR:client_util.cc(442)] Could not find exported function RelaunchChromeBrowserWithNewCommandLineIfNeeded\n\nThe reason chrome.dll can't be found is because C:\\Users\\V2B\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\22.0.1229.79 doesn't exist.

When selected, a new folder is created at the same level as the current selection in the project tree. If nothing in the project tree is selected (for example, if a file in the working set is selected), the folder is created at the root of the project folder.\n\nThe _Rename_ command is added to the project context menu. It will rename the selected file or folder. Note that the _Rename_ command will only work on project tree items. You cannot rename a file in the working set.\n\nAPI NOTES\n\n`DocumentManager` dispatches a new `fileNameChange` event whenever the name of a file or folder has changed. \n\n`DirectoryEntry.getDirectory()` is now implemented. This will return a reference to an existing directory or create a new directory if needed.\n\nUNIT TESTS\n\nUnit tests are added for rename(), but not directory creation.

This is inspired by this user story https://trello.com/card/2-status-bar-bottom/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/337\n\n**NOTES**\n\nI'm creating this pull request because I'm not sure about the right process and maybe I'm going a little over my head here... I think it still needs some work and discussion if you'd want to add it, so maybe it would be best if it could be forked and polished to reach a better state before trying to merge it.\n\n\n**INFORMATION**\n\nAs suggested in the card, the status bar sits at the bottom of the editor and shows the **line and column number**, **number of lines**, **mode** and **current tab setting** for the current focused editor.\n\n**API**\n\n    exports.showBusyIndicator = showBusyIndicator;\n    exports.hideBusyIndicator = hideBusyIndicator;\n\nThese APIs are a possible solution (at least partial) for the story in this card https://trello.com/card/ui-for-long-running-operatons/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/551. The status bar includes a *busy* indicator that any module can show or hide through these methods. Additionally, `showBusyIndicator` takes one optional parameter to set a busy cursor over Brackets until `hideBusyIndicator` is called.\n\nIn this pull request, the `Find in Files` module has been updated to show the busy indicator and cursor while waiting for the search operation to complete.\n\n    exports.addIndicator = addIndicator;\n    exports.updateIndicator = updateIndicator;\n\nThese APIs allow any module to add an indicator on the status bar and update it at any time.\n\n`addIndicator` takes an `id` (module.id could be nice) and other optional parameters such as `indicator`, `visible`, `style`, `tooltip` and `command`.\n\n`updateIndicator` takes the same parameters as the other except `indicator`. It allows to update the values with new ones to change the status indicator appearance and behavior.\n\n- If a DOM element `indicator` is passed, it will be added to the status bar. Otherwise, an empty `span` will be used.\n- The `visible` parameter sets the initial indicator visibility\n- The `style` parameter indicates a class to style the indicator\n- The `tooltip` parameter is set as the indicator `title` so that it appears as a tooltip when the mouse is over it\n- The `command` parameter indicates a function to be called on click over the indicator. (It could be used to show/hide the JSLint errors panel decoupling this from the enable/disable action as outlined in https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/brackets-dev/PqEbuhw7k6c\n\nIn this pull request, and just as a test for the API, the `JSLintUtils` module has been updated to add and update the indicator at the statusbar instead of at the toolbar. Also, the `UpdateNotification` module has been updated to show the gift icon as a status indicator.\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES**\n\n* The style for the status bar and the busy indicator are in serious need of a makeover :)\n* The information fields were not fully working with inline editors, so I didn't take them into account for now. Is it possible that inline editors are not triggering the `cursorActivity` event?\n* Indicator commands are not implemented waiting further discussion.\n* The `addIndicator` and `updateIndicator` APIs could be improved for better flexibility.\n\nSorry for the long and booring post :)\n\nPS: Although not yet finished, the status bar also comes in a Brackets Extension flavour https://github.com/jbalsas/brackets-statusbar-extension ;)"

It\'s a little more code change than I\'d like, so I\'m just putting this up for initial review now.\n\nThe overall changes are:\n* Instead of storing projects as just a path string, we store them as a "project info" object, which has the root path as well as a "type". Currently, the only types are "welcome" and "localFolder" (the idea being that in the future we could have other project types, with additional metadata). This applies to the pref for the last opened project as well as the list of recent projects maintained by the recent projects extension.\n* When accessing either the last opened project or the recent projects list, we check for the welcome project, and change its root path to be whatever the welcome project is for the currently running source folder.\n\nNote that we don\'t detect welcome projects from before this sprint, so people upgrading from Sprint 13 to Sprint 14 will still have the old welcome project in their last opened project/recent projects list. (However, the last opened project/recent projects list from older sprints will still be recognized even though they\'re in a different format.) We\'ll need to release note this.\n\nThe main concerns I have are that there are a fair number of cases that are affected, and the logic in the recent projects dropdown has changed enough that we really need to do a thorough retest. I\'ve tested the ones I could think of, but there might be more. \n\nHere are the cases I can think of, along with their expected behavior:\n1. Trash prefs and launch Brackets to get the Getting Started project. Quit Brackets. Restart Brackets with a new source folder. You should see the Getting Started project from the new folder.\n2. Trash prefs and launch Brackets to get the Getting Started project. Open another folder, so the recent projects dropdown now has the Getting Started project in it. Quit Brackets. Restart Brackets with a new source folder. The recent projects dropdown should now have the Getting Started project from the new folder.\n3. Like (1), but instead of restarting Brackets with a new source folder, just switch the language before relaunching. You should see the Getting Started project for the new language.\n4. Like (2), but instead of restarting Brackets with a new source folder, just switch the language before relaunching. You should see the Getting Started project for the new language in the recent projects dropdown.\n5. Trash prefs and launch Brackets Sprint 13. Open some folders. Quit Brackets. Launch Brackets Sprint 14. The last opened project and recent projects dropdown should still show what they showed in Sprint 13. (However, the Getting Started project from Sprint 13 will still be there.)\n\nNote that this also means that the last opened project/recent projects won\'t be saved if you downgrade from >=Sprint 14 to <Sprint 14.\n\nWe need to add some unit tests for all this stuff. Some of these cases will be tricky to unit test, as it involves prefs being set up in certain ways and different source folders. Probably the only way to do it is to manually synthesize the prefs for each test. (Also, there weren\'t any unit tests for the recent projects dropdown to begin with...a by-product of the fact that the criteria for the last sprint were "just check it in" :) We probably need to write some.)'

In the meantime, typing still went  to the editor and clicks crashed (because the Quick Open toolbar is only half-constructed).\n\nThe fix is to open the UI immediately, but defer showing results that depend on the file index until it's ready.

1596,'RaymondLim','Show code hints on change instead of keyup\nUPDATED: Ready for final review.\n\nThe change is the one Peter proposed in #1415--show the code hints on change instead of on keyup. A couple of questions about the fix:\n\n* With the original setup, there was never any danger that you wouldn\'t eventually process the "showCodeHintsOnKeyUp" flag, because the browser (presumably) guarantees that you get a keyup for every keydown. However, with this fix, there\'s no guarantee you\'ll get a CodeMirror "change" event after a keydown. In general, you always should, because any key that would trigger code hints should theoretically cause a change event to happen eventually. But I just wanted another set of eyes on this to make sure there wasn\'t some other way to get into a state where "showCodeHintsOnChange" would end up being left hanging and not processed until some later unrelated change event.\n\n* The way CodeHintManager is currently set up, it doesn\'t actually attach to/detach from the current editor to handle key events. Instead, there\'s just a hardcoded call to the CodeHintManager from Editor. I followed that same pattern for the change event handling, but it seems like a bad inverse dependency. Is there a reason we did it this way originally? Should we change it to attach/detach listeners as the current editor changes?'

(B) and (C), but likely also (A) would be slightly more efficient because we save at least one method call.\n\n(A) is a direct mapping of the file structure. However, when developing, I only think "I want to access Brackets\' DocumentManager", so (B) would be more straightforward for me. Also, it is shorter and removes redundancy (2x "document"). It still seems unnecessarily verbose, though, so my favorite is (C).\n\nA disadvantage of (B) and (C) is that they make it harder to find the source code of DocumentManager (say, for reference). One would either have to check the class at runtime or search the code for `brackets.document = ...` which is likely to fail if the assignment is done in a different way. However, ideally the developers should not need to read the source code unless they want to modify the DocumentManager. Instead, they should refer to some separate documentation.\n\nThe advantage of (C) is that it accelerates development. `brackets.documents` is so succinct that I don\'t find it necessary to first declare a variable at the top of the file and then use it somewhere later. In addition I don\'t have the impulse to go to some older file and copy and paste the line because it contains so much boilerplate that I don\'t want to remember and/or type manually. Lastly, the code using the document manager would be easier to reuse in other files since it does not rely on `DocumentManager` to be predefined somewhere else.\n\nAll approaches would allow for changes in the file structure without breaking extensions. More interestingly, they allow replacing some Brackets modules with custom ones or using entirely different implementations if that is necessary (e.g. a LocalDocumentManager and a CloudDocumentManager, depending on where Brackets is running).\n\nWhat do you think?'

[...] The editor is __not yet visible or attached to a host editor__." Yet, this function triggers the focusedEditorChange event.\n\nConsequently, if a handler then calls getFocusedEditor() it will get the editor that is about to lose focus, not the one that just got focus. Since the focusedEditorChange event does not pass along the editor it replaces, this behavior could be relied upon to determine which editor previously had focus. But depending on which part of the documentation is correct, this behavior could change.\n\nAlso, an event handler for focusedEditorChange might call a function that is otherwise independent of the event and therefore needs to call getFocusedEditor(). It would then not get the editor that now has focus.\n\nIn my opinion focusedEditorChange should only be triggered when the new editor is visible and actually has the focus - as documented. getFocusedEditor() would then return the same editor as passed on by the event.\nIn addition, I would pass the previously focused editor to the handler function as well.\n\n    function onFocusedEditorChange(event, editor, previousEditor)'

The problem with the unit tests was that they weren\'t using the JSUtils that had been loaded by the extension. Instead, they were using a different JSUtils loaded in the same require context that loaded SpecRunner (i.e. the wrong window).\n\nThis worked for some unit tests because they were just testing "independent" functionality of JSUtils. However, JSUtils reaches in to the DocumentManager in some tests. Thus, these tests were failing because they were getting the wrong DocumentManager inside the JSUtils code (even though the unit test code was accessing the correct DocumentManager).\n\nI added code to the ExtensionLoader that allows us to retrieve require contexts for extensions using the name of the extension. (This is the first commit).\n\nThen, I modified the unit tests to request the JSUtils module from the extension\'s context. This fixed the unit tests. (This is the second commit).\n\nThere were also a few bugs in one of the unit tests. I fixed those too.\n\nWe should think about re-architecting how we run unit tests. It might make sense for each test window to import (a modified) SpecRunner and then load a particular test spec and run it. Then, the modified SpecRunner could report the results back to the main test window.

If you undo back to your previous save state, the document is still marked dirty. This avoids the data loss issue from 152, but is not as good from the user's point of view. We'll add a user story to the product backlog to get back to the previous functionality."

This is important for reducing how frequently core features break due to buggy extensions.\r\n* Events can be marked deprecated, causing `on()` to issue warnings -- this provides much more specific feedback than our current deprecation warnings, at dispatch time.  (In the future, we could also issue warnings when `on()` is called for an event that the object doesn't actually support).\r\n* Easier to debug, since the dispatch code is much simpler.\r\n* Event dispatching is 11x faster (although the overhead was not huge to begin with).\r\n* Uses less memory, since `$(nonDOMObj).on()` leaks memory in jQuery\r\n* The API is a bit simpler, eliminating some pitfalls (e.g. jQuery lets you pass single handler arguments directly, but multiple arguments must be wrapped in an array; here we just use varargs instead).\r\n\r\nThis initial demonstration converts Document & DocumentManager to use the new system, plus unit tests to verify more of its functionality.\r\n\r\nCC @dangoor -- this was the experiment I mentioned back at MAX."

The language uses unicode extensively, and some unicode characters are really not made to work in monospaced fonts.\r\n\r\nSo this font is almost a monospace font: every character has the same width except for a few characters that have twice that much width.\r\n\r\nFor instance the ellipsis character … takes twice the space as a letter.\r\n\r\nOn most editors, typing on this font will make it so that characters are still perfectly aligned. So that two lines with 10 … characters and 20 "a" characters will both have the same length. But in brackets this does not happen; for some reason, the line with 10 … characters is longer than the line with 20 "a" characters!\r\n\r\nSee the attached screenshot for a comparison of brackets vs kate (on Ubuntu Linux).\r\n\r\n![font alignment kate vs brackets](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3836039/4222721/133f6658-3916-11e4-9921-976a8cc08451.png)\r\n\r\nHow can this be fixed?\r\n\r\nThe .ttf font can be found on [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5v5BwwjTyERR2Z3VVo4OVdKc2M/edit?usp=sharing).

It would be nice to add a little note there that you can install new themes from Extension Manager, or actually have a link that takes you to the Extension Manager Themes tab.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it would make sense for Brackets to switch to a new theme as soon as you install it from Extension Manager, instead of making you manually go to View > Themes and switch to it there (since it's very likely that after installing a theme you'd want to switch to it right away)."
8930,'dangoor',"ProjectManager.getAllFiles() doesn't usually honor includeWorkingSet=false (the supposed default)\nInvoking `ProjectManager.getAllFiles()` (or more explicitly, `ProjectManager.getAllFiles(null, false)`) often yields an array that includes files outside the project that are open in the working set.  This happens any time someone has called `ProjectManager.getAllFiles(true)` earlier.\r\n\r\nMost callers supposedly don't want working-set entries that are outside the project -- only Find in Files & Quick Open pass `true`.  But since this bug has existed seemingly since Sprint 36 (a7a551d4f72092ac69b4aa2003a629072f2d0b03), those callers have been getting project-external items in the result list anyway.  So presumably this doesn't cause any major ill effects for most callers.\r\n\r\nThis happens because getAllFiles() reuses a cached result, and when `includeWorkingSet` is true it modifies the cache in-place to include the extra files.  It should make a copy instead to prevent tainting the cache used by future callers."

So it can\'t be changed easily at runtime, and has performance side-effects that may not be obvious to users.\r\n\r\nIdeally we wouldn\'t need any special FileSystem-level filtering at all. It\'d be great if we had a generic preference for excluding things from getAllFiles() clients without excluding them from the filesystem overall.  That way we wouldn\'t traverse into those subtrees automatically, but they could still be exposed in the project tree for manual traversal (maybe with special styling indicating they’re "excluded" folders or such).  With auto-recursive file watching on two of three platforms, we\'re tantalizingly close to that: if no one ever asks FileSystem to traverse into a subtree like .git or node_modules, it\'ll never be loaded, never take up cache space, and never be processed by a file-watcher listener.

This was true on master too, but the consequences were more subtle (not all of the text was selected when clicking the Find In Files matches, but that\'s about it).  This affects only in-memory replacements because on-disk replacement uses different range info that doesn\'t have this problem.\r\n\r\nWhen we fix this, we should do some extra testing around `FindInFiles._updateResults()`, since that code has evidently never been exercised with match records that span multiple lines.

This seems like it makes even the trend of percentages over time meaningless (since we can\'t assume the degree of story parallelization is always the same).\r\n\r\n> Since this wasn\'t in the original story criteria and doesn\'t seem to be well defined/specified, maybe we should just remove or comment out this block of code for now?'

It works fine with HTML. I have tested all the suggestions on the troubleshooting page and searched the topics for similar problems.\r\n\r\nThe case I am testing is very simple: a folder including only a .html and a .css file. The .html file refers to the .css file. The .html includes only some simple very basic code, including a header with a certain ID. The .css defines the background color of this header.\r\n\r\nWhen I activate Live Preview Chrome opens and shows the page perfectly. When I alter the text in the header, it is immediately updated in Chrome (without saving or refreshing).\r\n\r\nWhen I go to a css line, the Live Preview highlights the section which the css line relates to. However, when I change for example the color in the css line (either in the .css file or in the quick edit view), nothing is changed in the preview in Chrome.\r\nWhen I then save the files (html and css) and refresh the Chrome webpage, still nothing changes. (the Live Preview is still working for the html and to highlight the sections)\r\n\r\nWhen I then disable Live Preview and enable it again, the page is reopened in Chrome with the new color. However, when I refresh the page in Chrome (without changing anything else), the color is changed back to its original color, while this 'setting' is nowhere in the css anymore (the adjustment has been saved).\r\n\r\nThe same works the other way around: when I change the color say from yellow to red, save the file and refresh the Chrome page (Live Preview is constantly on) I see that it does not update the view (still yellow). If I then, before doing anything else, change the color back again to it's original color (yellow) in the css file, save the file and disable Live Preview to enable it again, the page is shown with a red header background...\r\n\r\nI get the feeling that I am missing something obvious here because it doesn't work at all with css while it works with html, but I can't figure out how to get it working."

7261,'ingorichter',"[Inline editor] delete line moves the editor if function is defined above\nWhen opening up the inline editor for a function that is defined above the current selection in the same file, adding/deleting lines in the inline editor makes the editor move. This is of course because the number of lines has been changed which then naturally would increase or decrease the position of the inline editor. However, I find it a bit annoying to work with an inline editor that moves around when I'm editing in it.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to compensate the line changes by scrolling the main editor so that the inline editor always stays at the same position. This can of course only be done when the editor is positioned in a way that it is scrollable."

6600,'dangoor',"Have a way to cause reloads for non-live server files\nIf I'm understanding the code correctly, in Live Development we only trigger a reload when saving a non-live file if we think the browser requested it (e.g. a JS file). That won't trigger for server files that aren't actually requested by the browser. For example, if you edit a .erb view file in a Rails project, saving it won't trigger a reload.\r\n\r\nI think we did this because there are various files you might edit that aren't related to the current page, and we don't have any way of distinguishing between the two cases. However, perhaps it would be worth having a way to specify certain file extensions as triggering a reload. It could still cause too many reloads, since you might (for example) edit a view file that's not relevant to the current page you're previewing.

Thus, I created an extension called [Legibility](https://github.com/stowball/brackets-legibility) and manually changed font-sizes, line-heights, heights, widths etc to make them readable.\r\n\r\nThis took a lot of inspecting and trial and error to get right.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better if you changed all of these values to use rems (you could write a mixin to divide the target value by 16), that way, a user would simply need to change the font-size on html for the whole app to scale.\r\n\r\nYou could implement this natively - similar to Code Mirror zooming (Ctr+Shift+ -/+, perhaps?) or an extension developer could easily write something to allow an end user to change the UI size to match their needs.\r\n\r\nI think this is really important - everyone is different and needs different sizes to be able to use Brackets comfortably.

4986,'peterflynn','Extension API Evolution: module loader\nI came across the Extension API research:\r\nhttps://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-API-Research\r\n\r\nand curious to know if you need any background or ideas on how to use an AMD loader more effectively for what you need.\r\n\r\nThe main issue seemed to be using modules installed via NPM in brackets for brackets extensions. This would work out better if there was a process that added a bridge module in the node_modules directory to the "main" module in the node_modules area. Then setting the loader\'s baseUrl config to \'node_modules\' would work out. \r\n\r\nThis assumes that the packages installed do not have nested node_modules dependencies. At first thought I would expect you would not want that anyway given that it meant extra code getting downloaded for in-browser use. However, they could be supported in an AMD loader by using [map config](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-map) if they were desired.\r\n\r\nI have an in-process project to write out those adapter modules for node_modules, then also to convert them to AMD format by just adding a define() around the modules installed. Although, I think it is completely fine to also just author the modules in AMD format. People are already using npm for non-node, browser only code, so a concern about module format should not be an issue. But either way, a post-install tool that sets up the bridge modules could also optionally wrap the modules.\r\n\r\nIf you need some of those same modules to run in a backing node process, [r.js can be used in node](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html#usage) to load those modules in node, and it could reuse the same config you use for the front end.\r\n\r\nThis way you could take advantage of the callback require() available in AMD loaders as well as loader plugins, for things like text files, template and transpiled languages. Both of those features have companions in ES6 Modules space, so I expect it will be easy to transition use of them to ES6. The callback require for delayed loading of front end code is also a pretty standard feature request for a project the size of Brackets.\r\n\r\nYou may have other requirements I have missed, so just offering help in case you think an additional exploration down this path might be useful. No worries though if you have it sorted.\r\n'

3205,'dangoor',"Returning errors from Node-side code should be more consistent\nRight now we have several approaches to signaling errors in code that ran on the node side:\r\n\r\n1. Invoke callback with first arg an Error object _(used in ExtensionManagerDomain.\\_cmdInstall())_\r\n2. Invoke callback with first arg something else (e.g. an enum string indicating an error code, or an array including an error code and additional info) _(used in StaticServerDomain.\\_createServer(), ExtensionManagerDomain.\\_cmdDownloadFile(), etc.)_\r\n3. Invoke callback with first arg null, and second arg contains an `error`, `errors`, etc. property _(used in ExtensionManagerDomain.\\_cmdInstall())_\r\n\r\nAll three have some downsides:\r\n\r\n1. ConnectionManager.sendCommandError() doesn't properly serialize Error objects (because they don't JSON.stringify() nicely).  We'd also need an expando convention or standard subclass if we wanted to pass any info beyond a string error code.\r\n2. Passing something other than an Error as the first arg seems uncommon in the Node world.\r\n3. It feels counterintuitive to pass a success object in the case of failure, and it means client code needs per-command logic to decide whether to call resolve() vs. reject().  (See Package.installFromURL() for an example -- there are three different ways that install() can lead to a reject()).  This also seems fairly uncommon in Node.\r\n\r\nExtension install/validation is an especially tricky use case because it has some gray areas.  For example, if you call validate() and it is able to correctly unpack the ZIP file but it finds that the extension inside it is invalid, is that a successful validation that returns errors or is it a failure?  _(I think Kevin and I would both say the former)._  But if you call install() and it decides to abort because the extension failed validation, _that_ is probably a failure not a success.  But what if the extension was 'successfully installed' into the disabled folder?  Is that success, or failure?  _(I think I'd argue that should be a failure in both cases, since the ultimate goal of the action -- installing an extension that we can then attempt to invoke -- did not actually succeed.  Distinguishing partial failure (disabled folder) vs. complete failure (we didn't unpack the ZIP anywhere at all) is still valuable but that could still be done via properties or error codes on the failure object)._"

So instead of `CodeMirror.getMode(config, {name: "xml", htmlMode: true})` it would do `CodeMirror.getMode(config, "text/html")`).

This is the case for the change and deleted event, but not for the saved event, which I have to register for via the DocumentManager.\n\nRegistering with the DocumentManager has the advantage that I only have to do it once. It has the disadvantage that whenever something happens to any document (it was saved, changed, ...) I have to decide over and over again whether I actually care, i.e. whether I can handle that file type at all, etc.\n\n# Ambiguous Event Names\n\nCurrently two styles are used: present tense (currentDocumentChange, change), past tense (documentSaved, deleted)\nThe same verb is used for different events: "currentDocumentChange" is used when the user switches to a different document, "change" is used when a document is modified. Nothing keeps me from interpreting onCurrentDocumentChange as "when the current document was modified".\n\n# Missing Event Details\n\ncurrentDocumentChange currently does not provide any information at all. This means we have to figure out not just which document is now open (if any), but also which document was open before (for cleanup). The latter requires storing the new document in a variable somewhere outside the handler so I still have access to it when currentDocumentChange is triggered. My suggestion would be another parameter:\n\n\tfunction onCurrentDocumentChange(event, doc, previousDoc) {\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nAfter all, a change occurs from something to something else.\n\n# Synchronization\n\nAs an extension developer I usually want to deal with the current open document, so I listen to currentDocumentChange. But extensions are loaded after Brackets restores its state, so by the time I register for currentDocumentChange, a document has already been opened (usually) and I have to call my handler manually to notice that.\n\nWith jQuery\'s document ready event, the behavior is different: if the DOM is ready before you register for the event, the handler just gets called right away. Granted, this is more intuitive for document ready, since it describes a state ("ready"), not a transition ("change").\n\nI see three alternatives:\n1. when registering for currentDocumentChange, just call the handler if there already is a document.\n2. Like 1, but with a name for the event that suggests this behavior\n3. Load extensions before restoring the previous state of Brackets\n\nAlternative 3 generally makes sense, although it is tricky to implement (extensions have to tell Brackets when they are fully loaded, which might require asynchronous actions) and might slow down the startup of Brackets - or at least the time until it\'s fully usable.\n\nHowever, for extensions loaded later (with the extension manager), alternative 3 would still not be enough.\n\n# Files vs. Documents\n\nI wanted to do something with all files the user opened. I assumed those were the files listed in the top left corner (not those below, in the directory tree). I found getAllOpenDocuments() which seemed to match my intention. To my surprise, it did not list all the files I considered to be "open". It listed the current file, sure enough, and also some other files (probably files used by the current file), but some were missing. Huh.\n\nSo I had a look at getWorkingSet(). Previously I assumed that the working set refers to the files in the folder that I opened, but I was wrong. The working set actually means what I considered to be "open files". However, it does not contain objects of type Document, it contains objects of type FileEntry.\n\nAlright, luckily there is getDocumentForPath. So I\'d just call that and get my documents. And then I would look at doc.extension to decide whether I can actually handle that file - but no. doc.extension isn\'t always set! It\'s set somewhere in LiveDevelopment.js by _setDocInfo, along with the file URL that I use so often. So I have to extract the extension myself. Cumbersome!\n\nSo for one I would enhance Document to always provide the extension (for filtering) and the URL (for LiveDevelopment stuff, but even before we\'re live). Maybe URLs should even be the primary designators for files since Brackets is supposed to run in the Browser, too - I might not have access to any local files there. Then again, in the cloud scenario, those files might still be read by a server process that can make sense of paths. That\'s for you to decide.\n\nBut also I wonder whether we can\'t get rid of the separation between documents and file entries, at least for the working set. A document does not have to be loaded - it\'s enough to have it load automatically when calling getText(), for instance. So I doubt efficiency is the issue here.\n\nMaybe extension and url actually belong to files. So I would call doc.file.extension, doc.file.url, doc.file.fullPath, etc. - that makes sense, too.'

Having only closeFullEditor() be a public API doesn\'t feel so bad.\r\n\r\n**Minimal-churn proposal:**\r\nMake removeFromWorkingSet() public and redefine it to basically do everything that closeFullEditor() does (i.e. what it does now, plus ensuring the removed file isn\'t the currentDocument).  The FILE_CLOSE command would call this method, and we could remove closeFullEditor().\r\n\r\nWe could also factor out a getNextEditor() API that could be shared between the ensure-not-currentDocument logic and future commands like Ctrl+Tab.\r\n\r\n**Low-churn proposal:**\r\nMake removeFromWorkingSet() public but have it not do anything more than it does today.  Also add a public getNextEditor() as above.  Then the FILE_CLOSE command would basically do what closeFullEditor() does today, leaning on those two DocumentManager APIs.\r\n\r\nDownside: DocumentManager still needs that same behavior, in the case where a document\'s file has been wholly deleted on disk.  So there\'d be some code duplication between DocumentCommandHandlers (FILE_CLOSE) and DocumentManager (notifyFileDeleted()).\r\n\r\n**Higher-churn \'clean\' proposal:**\r\nIt feels a bit archaic that DocumentManager owns the working set and currentDocument state at all.  So, move that stuff to EditorManager; DocumentManager would _only_ manage the list of \'open\'/active (refCount > 0) Documents.  EditorManager would have a public API much like today\'s closeFullEditor().  FILE_CLOSE would call it directly, and in the case of deletion EditorManager could probably just listen directly for its Editors\' "lostContent" event.\r\n\r\nThis decouples things a bit more cleanly, but it involves moving a _lot_ of code/APIs from DocumentManager to EditorManager, and updating all callers accordingly.'
