Unfortunately this seems to be the default configuration for the new XCode6 simulators. \r\n\r\nIt's easy enough to toggle the 'Enable Hardware Keyboard' option off locally, but I think the only way to get this set up on Travis would be to write an applescript to toggle it off.

Initially I was using the default port and in some builds it would work for one version of node and not for the other see [build 181](https://travis-ci.org/Khan/KaTeX/builds/37080015).\r\n\r\nSo I thought that maybe if I switched to a different port so I switch to 4445.

2788,'','intermittent buggy os.statvfs() behavior\nOur python project (https://travis-ci.org/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/) has one unit test which exercises an internal "how much disk space is available?" utility function, which uses `os.statvfs()` to see how much disk space is used and available. The unit test asserts that the "used" space is nonzero.\r\n\r\nThis test is failing randomly when we run it on Travis, and statvfs() claims that the disk is entirely empty. I added some debug messages to capture the full statvfs() output: on the one test where it failed (https://travis-ci.org/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/jobs/35096649), it looked like this the entire run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nposix.statvfs_result(f_bsize=4096, f_frsize=4096, f_blocks=5242880, f_bfree=5242880, f_bavail=5242880, f_files=2621440, f_ffree=2621439, f_favail=2621439, f_flag=4096, f_namemax=255)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `f_blocks == f_bfree` means that the disk is empty.  That number of blocks corresponds to exactly 20 GiB. (this was on worker-linux-5-1.bb.travis-ci.org:travis-linux-10)\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the "f_bfree" value (the number of free 4KiB blocks) remain unchanged throughout the 40-minute test run. In fact, all of the values returned by statvfs (including f_files) were exactly the same for every call during that test run. On passing runs, f_bfree varies up and down constantly (more than would be expected from our unit tests: I think the VMs hosting these jobs are visibly sharing disks between guests). Since the test is writing out logfiles and using temporary files, we expect the space-used to be mostly going up during the run.\r\n\r\nMost of the workers I\'ve seen have exactly 120GiB total (f_blocks), and varying amounts of free space. A few workers have had stranger values (361.24 GiB, 427.928 GiB). The one failing case for which I have complete data reported 20 GiB.\r\n\r\nMy hunch is that certain VMs (or certain hosts) are faking the filesystem somehow: their statvfs() call returns some fixed values (20GiB sounds like a nice round number) and not bothering to fake disk space being used at all.\r\n\r\nWe\'re considering changing our tests to be less picky (https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/2290), but it\'d be useful to know whether this is an intentional behavior, or indicates a deeper problem.\r\n'

If a script or test suite takes longer to run, the job will be forcefully terminated and you will see a message about this in your build log. With our current timeouts, a job will be terminated if it's still running after 50 minutes (120 minutes on travis-ci.com), or if there hasn't been any log output in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt would be great, if:\r\n\r\n- the 50 minute timeout value was increased to lets say 90 minutes perhaps\r\n- better if the timeout value could be configurable per projects\r\n\r\nWe have scripts that execute after the build that along with the build execution itself could take longer than 50 minutes to generate.

One such job, which we will not restart, is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/jruby/jruby/jobs/33014355\r\n\r\nHere, it seems like connectivity to sonatype (snapshot repository to most of the OSS world) was not reachable.

2665,'','Build script not failing on pipes any more\nWith the recent refactoring to `travis_cmd` in travis-build we have also moved from bash-expanding the given command to bash-`eval`ing it. I.e. previously we\'ve done something along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd="./run/this.sh"\r\n$cmd\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we are doing something along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd="./run/this.sh"\r\neval "$cmd"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in a change which can either be seen as a regression or fix, depending on the perspective, in cases where users run commands and pipe their output to something else. E.g. the following used to exit with `0`, but now exits with `1`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfalse | tee\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is that Bash expansion behaves differently from both running commands manually, and `eval`ing them. Only using Bash expansion it would exit with the exit status of the command piped to, not the command piped from.\r\n\r\nTravis CI has, as far as I can tell, supported this for years, and thus we might choose to see this as a regression and try to find a fix (see below). On the other hand one might argue that the previous behaviour is quite contra-intuitive and actually contradicts our [documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/), and the behaviour change should be considered a fix for a longstanding bug.\r\n\r\nAfter having a few discussions I\'d personally tend to keep the current behaviour, clarify things in our docs more, and add a hint about workarounds: The current behaviour is what one would see when using Bash defaults, and running commands manually. Thus, this seems to be the less confusing behaviour to me. Also workarounds are trivial.\r\n\r\nThe following script shows the differences between running a plain bash command, bash-expanding it, and bash-`eval`ing it. It also shows how `set -o pipefail` can be used by users in order to restore the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n \r\nfunction run() {\r\n  true | tee\r\n  echo "$?

2640,'henrikhodne','Bundler args ignored when language is objective-c\nI use bundler to manage the ruby dependencies ([Cocoapods][]) of my iOS projects. One of my projects also uses [Shenzen][] which needs Nokogiri.

With the current system I have to schedule [eight builds](https://travis-ci.org/servo/servo/builds/31399484), which seems like a wastage of resources.\r\n\r\nIt might be more efficient for Travis to "fork" the VM after building, and running the tests in parallel.\r\n\r\nWhat I\'m thinking of is a key `script_test:`, which is run immediately after `script`*, and a separate `test_matrix` key for `env` (et cetera). This forks the VM only after the build completes, and schedules test runs on each fork.\r\n\r\nIt might also be easier to just copy over the build directory, though this means reinstalling dependencies.\r\n\r\n*The existing `after_script` key doesn\'t quite cut it since it is run _after_ success/failure has been determined, which is not where tests should go/'

This works fairly well - it takes about 5 minutes of CPU time to cancel all the unneeded jobs. However, it\'s clearly a hack. Also, the travis command line client is *insanely* slowwwww! Calling it ~100 times sequentially from inside a travis worker takes upwards of 10 minutes, so I used another hack and called it from multiple threads.

2548,'','Have a way to cancel a build if a newer commit happens\nWe (SymPy) have a use case that some of us tend to fire off a series of commits, never to notice that each and every of these commits causes a Travis build. Later, we tend to find that a lot of irrelevant commits have been tested but the latest and most interesting commit is still in the work queue; also, this wastes travis.org resources and we\'d like to avoid that.\r\nWe\'re aware of [skip ci] but that does not cover the use case: we want to cancel builds that were already queued (no way to insert that [skip ci] tag into GitHub) but have become irrelevant.\r\nWe\'re also aware that one can always manually cancel builds, which covers the case of diligent developers but does not cover the sloppy ones who simply fire off the commits and aren\'t aware, don\'t care or are too distracted to realize that they just tied up considerable testing resources.\r\n\r\nI toyed with making the build script check for newer commits, and fail if it found there\'s a newer commit. I dropped that approach for several reasons:\r\n- Test builds become nonrepeatable (a repeat will now always fail once a newer commit happens).\r\n- The only way to cancel a build from the script is to return a nonzero status, which will cause the test to show up as "failed" (red markers). SymPy welcomes new contributors and GSoC participants, which means we\'d burden people already taxed with learning technical details with yet another one, and one that may make them panic as well.\r\n- Also, I found it somewhat difficult to reliably detect that a newer commit on the same branch exists. This may be due to my inexperience with git, or with Travis, or with the way Travis pulls clones from the repository (the latter being something that may change without notice so I\'m unsure whether this might not add maintenance load to SymPy).\r\n- If a test should be run anyway (because maybe the user wants to see which in a series of commits caused a failure), he can\'t do that on Travis, not even by rescheduling the test (it will fail due to newer commits).\r\n\r\nI\'m not 100% sure what the best way to approach this request is. I can imagine different approaches:\r\na) Add an option to the project\'s Travis configuration files that specifically handles this case. Make sure that a rescheduled test does not do the check.\r\nb) Let the projects control that from their build scripts.\r\nb1) Provide more information to scripts: are there newer commits on the same branch (this may amount to a documentation snippet that tells people how to script that, and makes Travis CI contributors aware that they should make sure that this information isn\'t obscured by specifics of Travis CI\'s git clone/checkout machinery)? Is this a rescheduled run or the first one? (Possibly other info.)\r\nb2) Give scripts an option to return a "cancelled without pass/fail conclusion", showing up as a grey marker just like the cancels from the web interface do.'

2505,'',"Request: Setting to have Travis automatically cancel an old PR request on a new commit to the same PR\nIn our repository, our tests take a LOOOONG time to run.  Many contributors create a PR, and then iteratively push commits as review happens.  On every push, Travis queues up a build for their PR.  This even happens if they force push and the commit is no longer available.  Since Travis runs the queued requests in order, it is essentially running a LOT of build that have been superceded and thus are no longer necessary.  I find myself having to manually cancel old queued up builds, just so they don't get executed, otherwise they hold up the rest of the queue for basically no reason.\r\n\r\nSo, the request is to have a setting where old requests for the same PR are canceled automatically when a new commit is detected.  I'm suggesting a setting, because there may(?) be people who want the old builds to run.  I would think this setting would help Travis on the hosting side as well, because it's that many builds it won't have to run."

It appears that Travis switched from Clang 3.3 to 3.4 between (our) builds 129 and 130. Specifically, a lot more SIGFPE and SIGILL exceptions have arisen and the failures have skyrocketed (48 before, 367 after). This same increase was not seen under the gcc build. However, it appears that even Clang 3.3 was producing SIGILL errors under our testing suite as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, seeing SIGILL exceptions suggests that Travis' build of Clang is not generating the correct instructions for the VMs. It's also possible that this is a Clang issue instead, but I'm not seeing much on Google about SIGILL exceptions using Clang.

But if the first one run in that matrix fails, I don\'t care whether the rest succeed. So we can see all 12 combinations failed in this example. Let\'s say 2590.1 ended with a failed status first. In my mind, 1 environment failing thats not in my allowed failure list in the travis.yml should cancel all of the other 2590.x builds, and set them to a "failed" status, not a cancelled status, with a message output that says "2590.1 failed, and the travis.yml says not to do this build if another environment fails".\r\n\r\nThis would allow repositories who have a large number of environments from having to watch each travis build and manually cancel all of them if one fails. And since cancelling doesn\'t change the build status, if the previous build status was succeeded, and the first one of the current build fails, and I cancel the rest, the build status icon will still deceptively show a build status of green.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?'

1998,'',"One test (out of hundreds) fails randomly for a node.js module\nI have originally posted the following issue to [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22013806/travis-ci-node-build-failing-randomly) and then later to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/travis-ci/leogeTdz-zM). I haven't received any answers there so I'm trying here.\r\n\r\nI have a problem with one [node module](https://github.com/SoftwareMarbles/nock/tree/fix-travis-build) on which all tests are working locally, on other boxes and on Travis-CI but sometimes, and not due to a timeout, one single test fails on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/SoftwareMarbles/nock/builds). The test is deterministic, at least according to me, so it shouldn't fail randomly.\r\n\r\nI've traced the problem to this part:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction record(rec_options) {\r\n\r\n    //  Originaly the parameter was a dont_print boolean flag.\r\n    //  To keep the existing code compatible we take that case into account.\r\n    var typeof_rec_options = typeof(rec_options);\r\n    var dont_print = (typeof_rec_options === 'boolean' && rec_options)\r\n      || (typeof_rec_options === 'object' && rec_options.dont_print);\r\n    var output_objects = typeof_rec_options === 'object' && rec_options.output_objects;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n        var out = !output_objects ?\r\n          generateRequestAndResponse(body, options, res, datas) :\r\n          generateRequestAndResponseObject(body, options, res, datas);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the value of `rec_options` being `{ dont_print: true, output_objects: true }`, `var output_objects` is evaluated (again only *sometimes*) as `false` so the function outputs strings and not objects upon which the test, correctly, fails. The proof that the flag evaluation fails can be seen in [this build](https://travis-ci.org/SoftwareMarbles/nock/jobs/19522596) which dumps out string instead of objects (also I have a test to ensure that the returned value is an object whenever `output_objects` is specified and that fails as well showing `string` where `object` was expected).\r\n\r\nAccording to me this should never happen and `output_objects` is not defined ambiguously and certainly not randomly. And yet this is exactly what happens time after time.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?"

This can be confusing. For example, Travis may say “Job has been successfully canceled.” atop the page of a job that has not been cancelled.\r\n\r\nThen, these notifications start to disappear, causing the page to jump, seemingly randomly.\r\n\r\nHere’s how it should work:\r\n\r\n1. When I press the cancel button, display a notification banner at the top of the page saying “Job cancellation has been scheduled.”\r\n2. When the job has been successfully cancelled, replace the previous banner with the new one saying “Job has been successfully canceled.” The old banner is no longer relevant.\r\n3. Clear these banners **only** when I navigate away from the page or click “⊗”. Do not remove them automatically!\r\n\r\nAnother really subtle bug is that the notifications overlap the “carrot” connecting the menu of the left to the repo on the right (look at the intersection, between the 3rd and 4th notifications in the screenshot above).'
1858,'henrikhodne',"Worker can send reset and finish events concurrently, leading to invalid matrix state\nAs originally summarized by @svenfuchs:\r\n\r\nWhen the worker runs a job it'll `ensure` to send a `:finished` event for the job:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker/blob/master/lib/travis/worker/job/runner.rb#L117\r\n\r\nThis also happens when it throws a `ConnectionError`, which is being rescued and subsequently finishes the job (https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker/blob/master/lib/travis/worker/instance.rb#L98-L100), sending a `:reset` event (https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker/blob/master/lib/travis/worker/instance.rb#L271 and https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-worker/blob/master/lib/travis/worker/reporter.rb#L80).\r\n\r\nSo, jobs which are being sent a `:reset` event also are being sent a `:finish` event. This means these events can be processed in parallel, and the containing build can end up calling `matrix_state` while a job has just been reset to `:created`\r\n\r\nThis could also result in multiple notification messages."

1855,'','Repeating Install Section of Build\n#### IRC conversation with deitarion:\r\n\r\n    deitarion: Travis seems to be having some kind of glitch where, after the test run, it waits an extra couple of minutes and then re-echos some install-phase output before reporting success or failure in the overall build status read-out.\r\n    deitarion: The extra install-phase output doesn\'t remain in the log if you reload, but the glitch does mean that one of my builds, which would normally complete in 5 or 6 minutes, is still waiting for the PyPy portion to complete at 11 minutes and 45 seconds in.\r\n    deitarion: (And I do mean waiting. The log shows that the build completed successfully but the status is still yellow and ticking away. I know it\'ll complete eventually because the py26 and py27 builds completed... they just took twice as long to switch in the dashboard.)\r\n    joshua-anderson: deitarion: I afraid I don\'t have a good answer for you, because I know nothing about pypi, but have you opened a bug report at github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues? Including a link to your .travis.yml would be a huge help too.\r\n    deitarion: joshua-anderson: It\'s not specific to PyPy. PyPy just happens to take significantly longer to complete in that project (even under normal circumstances) because Travis-CI isn\'t yet running the version with the performance fixes for coverage.py.\r\n    deitarion: Also, I was re-running a prior build. It\'s the exact same codebase and .travis.yml file which completed in less than half that time and without glitches a month or two ago.\r\n    joshua-anderson: Okay. I have you noticed this in any other projects on travis?\r\n    deitarion: No. I\'ve been swamped with other stuff for the last month and a half and this is the first time I\'ve touched Travis since then.\r\n    deitarion: I can try re-running an existing build on another project for comparison if you\'d like\r\n    joshua-anderson: If you\'re willing to put in the time :).\r\n    deitarion: I wonder if maybe it\'s a specific worker or set of workers that are having issues.\r\n    joshua-anderson: Can you tell what workers you have noticed this with? Should be first line of logfile\r\n    deitarion: http://pastebin.com/JuFk6GcS \r\n    deitarion: I ran 10 builds across two projects and those are the 10 worker ID strings.\r\n    joshua-anderson: Thanks!\r\n    deitarion: Also, did any of the projects you tested use a coveralls.io after_success hook?\r\n    deitarion: ...because all of my projects do, so I can\'t trigger a rebuild on one without it.\r\n    joshua-anderson: No none of them used coveralls\r\n    joshua-anderson: Does it happen every build for you?\r\n    joshua-anderson: And were all of these python?\r\n    deitarion: Yes. Both projects are Python and it\'s happened in both builds I tried.\r\n    deitarion: Correction: It\'s happened in all ten of the sub-builds within the two builds I tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have noticed the bug as well in the install section on c++ code.

(like the users of the project).\r\n<Aaron1011> Or it could actually include the job config/environment variables. However, it would be expensive to have to do it on-the-fly\r\n<HashNuke_> Aaron1011: So let the travis config mention the name for the env var group.\r\n<Aaron1011> HashNuke_: That\'s a great idea!\r\n<HashNuke_> Aaron1011: And then use the name in the badge. If the group name is "jruby1.6", then "jruby1.6:passing"\r\n<Aaron1011> The main problem is that currently, Travis just selects from a pre-defined image: build passing, build failing, build errored, or build unknown\r\n<Aaron1011> A new image would have to be generated for every single job\r\n<HashNuke_> Ah... I see the problem.\r\n<Aaron1011> on every single build, on every repo :)\r\n<HashNuke_> Aaron1011: Or just display the build status. Let the user use the group name on his/her readme on his own.\r\n<Aaron1011> HashNuke_: That would probably be better. Otherwise, Travis would have to host several gigabytes of images :)\r\n<HashNuke_> So in my readme, I would just type in "Jruby 1.6" and include the image which would only say "passing" or "failing".\r\n<HashNuke_> That way the current simplicity can be maintained.\r\n<Aaron1011> HashNuke_: That sounds good\r\n<Aaron1011> However, I\'m not sure about giving names to jobs\r\n<HashNuke_> (simplicity in reference to having very finite amt of images and serving those instead of generating them for each repo)\r\n<Aaron1011> The build matrix is expanded at Travis to create the list of jobs\r\n<Aaron1011> It might be better to name them in the web interface\r\n<HashNuke_> Aaron1011: anything that works.\r\n```'

1608,'',"Disable showing other repos and branches activity when looking at the particular build\nIts a feature request.\r\nUsually in our corporate workflow (I guess everywhere its the same), person works on a particular feature/bug on a particular branch. This person wants to succeed on his branch and rarely actively looking at all other stuff happening around.\r\n\r\nI propose you to think about a little bit different interface that is centered on the branch and pull request (like github does). In particular, there is no need to see update on all possible public builds that are happening on travis (left column). Its awesome that you are a growing company and a lot of people uses your system, but why would a particular developer care on a build of totally random project happening somewhere. Its better in corporate settings where number of repos are limited, but even then most of the people doesn't want to be distracted by routine failures and successes of his colleagues on different repos and on different branches.\r\n\r\nI personally would prefer to have a screen where I see only my builds from my branch and possibility to switch to overview screen where I can see all builds in a repo, and then maybe more global overview where I can see all builds on all repos in the company."
1607,'','Build logs on the build page are very slow and impossible to work with \nHi guys,\r\nIts really hard to inspect logs on the page for a project with more than 300 tests with py.test (or with extra log from building stuff).

The only way to work with logs is to open them with this button to download logs.'
1605,'',"Build scheduler rewrite\nThe current implementation of the build scheduler (a.k.a. enqueue) is reaching its limits, causing delays in scheduling jobs.\r\n\r\nThe underlying reason is our jobs table, which has now around 10 million records in it, causing queries to be rather long. Henrik looked into it, and what's really slow, even just when doing counts (which PostgreSQL isn't very efficient at), is looking at the running/queued jobs of an owner, taking up to 10 seconds per owner, causing the long delays we're seeing.\r\n\r\nThere's a mix of a slightly overloaded database, inefficient indexes involved, but we also use a rather large table for a working set that's actually very small (< 2000 rows, the most recent jobs that are runnable).\r\n\r\nFor me, the last part is what's turning into the bigger problem, and I'd like to propose a solution which takes away the need for querying such a large data set.\r\n\r\nWhen a new job is created, we also put a skeleton into a separate table, let's call it runnable_jobs. Gatekeeper creates it when the jobs are created.\r\n\r\nThat skeleton can be just a reference consisting of owner and job id, but it can also be the entire job configuration as an optimization step to avoid having any further lookups.\r\n\r\nA second table lists the owner's for which we currently have jobs running, e.g. active_owners, including the owner's id and the number of running/queued jobs for that owner.\r\n\r\nInstead of querying the jobs table, the scheduler now queries the running_jobs table, which has a very small data set, only the jobs that are actually runnable.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a job is runnable for an owner, the scheduler queries the active_owners table to determine how many jobs can be queued for this owner, or if any at all.\r\n\r\nWhen a build is queued, the entry in runnable_jobs can be removed as the status is updated in the jobs table for this particular job. The active_owners table includes the job for reference now and the jobs table will reflect the status of the job now.\r\n\r\nAfter the build has finished, the number of jobs for the owner is decreased accordingly.\r\n\r\nUpdates to several tables will have to be done in a transaction, to make sure the status is properly reflected across all of them.\r\n\r\nThis inarguably brings duplication, but it significantly reduces the data set that needs to be hit to schedule jobs.\r\n\r\nAs a further optimization, the scheduler can then be broken up into several threads or processes, with every one of them handling a subset of the runnable jobs, e.g. by way of hashing or simple partitioning.\r\n\r\nThis implementation isn't too far off from the current one, just reduces the data surface but sacrifices handling consistency across the tables.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think or if you have any alternative ideas."

Very similar error messages systematically occur for any Gradle build that I tried so far... We also have to check if it is not related to some Networking or Shared memory gaps, that are common source of troubles.\r\n\r\nOf course, we\'ll further investigate this problem, and do want to fix it during this beta phase.

1522,'henrikhodne','Reorganizing the documentation site\nI\'ve been thinking about this for a little while, and I think it may be time for us to reorganize our documentation site a bit. To me it feels like the site has gotten new content added to it for a while without a clear structure to it, so it\'s confusing where exactly things are. Looking in the sidebar, I see everything from topics to guides/how-tos to "FAQs".\r\n\r\nHere\'s what I\'d like to propose: We have a few (maybe five) main sections, which is listed on the main page. When you enter one of the main sections, the sidebar lists the pages under that section (and maybe the "master" pages for the other sections). Here\'s what I think may be good sections:\r\n\r\n- “**Build configuration**”. Needs a different name, but this\'ll contain things like the different build stages, a note on YAML syntax, ignoring branches, encrypting variables, etc.\r\n- **Languages**. This will contain information relevant to different languages. I haven\'t decided whether this should have sub-sections or sub-pages, although I\'m leaning towards the latter. The page for Ruby would contain information on how to use the `rvm` setting, what Ruby versions are provided (maybe not *as* relevant for Ruby since we do auto-installing, but this transfers to other languages), what the default build commands are, how to use `bundle_opts`, etc.\r\n- **Build Environment**. This contains information on what is installed on the VMs. There should be a page near the top of the section with "common" things that are installed on *all* images. Under that we can have Linux and OS X, then each language. There will be some duplication here with regards to what language runtimes are installed, but I think we can live with that.\r\n- **Deployment**. This contains all the information for how to deploy. This is already fairly well organized on our current site, so not much needs to be done here. One thing I think should be done is collect all the common options to the "main" deployment page, such as "only deploy on this branch".\r\n- **Notifications**. This contains information on notifications. There should be a quick overview page and a page for each notification type.\r\n\r\nWith all this we should also add better linking between the pages. For example, in the deploy section we can link to the config encryption page instead of having to explain the encryption over again.\r\n\r\nI\'m not saying this is the best way to organize things, but I do think we need something better than just a long list of pages which is what the sidebar currently looks like.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote: I\'m not a big fan of FAQs. For some things they may be necessary, for example “common build failures”. In this case I think it is really important to have search, and this should really only be for thing where you\'re looking for a solution to a very specific error. If you\'re reading up on deployment and trying to find out if it\'s possible to restrict deployment to a single branch, looking for “How do I restrict deployment to a single branch?” is not very helpful. I think we\'re doing pretty well with this so far, so I think we can more or less keep going like we are here.'
1521,'',"Strategy for when the build breaks on installing dependencies\nSometimes Travis is unable to install the dependencies, whatever the reason might be. With our current ```.travis.yml```, the build isn't canceled when it happens, wasting Travis resources and our time.\r\n\r\nWe're not using the ```instal``` directive in our ```.travis.yml```, but using a ```script``` (check https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/master/.travis.yml). I don't know if we installed the dependencies in ```install```, it would be the same, or Travis would stop the build if had any errors.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm wondering what's the best strategy to use in this case. Checking if everything was installed correctly in [our script](https://github.com/okfn/ckan/blob/master/bin/travis-build) feels wrong. Maybe if we extracted the install part to ```.travis.yml```, or better yet, if we could use a install script.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if Travis could retry tests that failed because of install issues.

Note that if you want to debate on the real added value of such "os selection" feature, I would recommend to post on the mailing list, so that we could keep this issue focused on a possible implementation.\r\n\r\nMy assumptions about an appropriate context/target for a first development iteration are following (open):\r\n* Discard closed/commercial systems to avoid licensing questions\r\n* Stay in clean Unix/Posix platforms to ease server provisioning (hard not to do so, if the point above is accepted ;-)\r\n* Providing 2 (or maximum 3) different systems in the os-matrix should be enough to validate the architecture.

I wish that we can get it soon online!\r\n\r\n**Android-specific Features in `.travis.yml`**\r\n\r\n* Emulator creation and auto-startup (optional, but enabled by default)\r\n * Note: the `wait_for_android_emulator` script will certainly be preinstalled as part of Android SDK, via `travis-cookbooks` setup phase.\r\n* Update SDK Components (optional, not sure if it should be enabled by default...?)\r\n* Auto-export typical android environment variables and mangae related build matrix\r\n\r\nSo, an android `.travis.yml` could look like following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlanguage: android\r\njdk:      openjdk7\r\nscript:   mvn install -Pintegration-tests -Dandroid.device=test\r\nandroid:\r\n  - { target: android-8,  sdks: [android-8],             abi: armeabi}\r\n  - { target: android-10, sdks: [android-10],            abi: armeabi}\r\n  - { target: android-16, sdks: [sysimg-16],             abi: armeabi-v7a}\r\n  - { target: android-17, sdks: [android-17, sysimg-17], abi: armeabi-v7a}\r\n\r\nandroid_toolkit:   # below would be default values...\r\n  start_emulator: true\r\n  update_sdk:     \'platform-tools,build-tools-18.0.1,extra-android-support,$ANDROID_TARGET,$ANDROID_SDKS\'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, `ANDROID_TARGET`, `ANDROID_SDKS` and `ANDROID_ABI` environment variables would be automatically exported.\r\n\r\n* if `android_toolkit.update_sdk`, default `before_install` will `echo y | android update sdk --filter ${travis_android_sdk_update_filter} --no-ui --force > /dev/null`\r\n* if `android_toolkit.start_emulator`, default `before_script` will: \r\n * `echo no | android create avd --force -n test -t $ANDROID_TARGET --abi $ANDROID_ABI`\r\n * `emulator -avd test -no-skin -no-audio -no-window &`\r\n * execution of kind of `wait_for_android_emulator` script, most probably inspired from [`embarkmobile/android-maven-example`](https://github.com/embarkmobile/android-maven-example/blob/master/wait_for_emulator)\r\n\r\nI know that having `android.target`, `android.sdks` and `android.abi` YAML-subelements is not quite *standard* in current Travis CI style (usually language attributes - `php`, `ruby`, ... - are just flat lists of versions), but so far I found it better than having something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nandroid:\r\n  - android-8\r\n...\r\n  - android-17\r\nandroid_sdks:\r\n  - android-8\r\n...\r\nandroid_abi:\r\n  - armeabi\r\n  - armeabi-v7a\r\n```\r\nthat would lead to matrix explosion (and certainly many cases to systematically exclude). The idea is to get something as simple as what people currently do with the generic `env.matrix`, but I\'m open to any other way to express it.\r\n\r\n**(My) Open Questions:**\r\n\r\n* @joshk do you agree with `android` YAML subelements syntax?\r\n* what would be the defaults for android target, sdks and abi? (for a single-row build matrix).\r\n* what would be the standard build `script` command to run for Gradle-based projects? `gradle connectedInstrumentTest` ?\r\n* what would be the standard build `script` command to run for Maven-based projects? `mvn install -Pintegration-tests -Dandroid.device=test` ?\r\n* what would be the standard build `script` command to run for Ant-based projects? `ant test` ?\r\n* Should emulator **name** (typically "test") or options (e.g. `-no-skin`) be configurable ?\r\n* Should emulator **creation**, **startup** and **wait_for** commands be more configurable (e.g. override startup command, sleep time, max retry) ? Having already `ANDROID_` vars and `wait_for_android_emulator`, it will be easy to override default `before_install` or `before_script` sequences\r\n* Is it common/realistic to start more than one emulator in the same test run?\r\n\r\n**Related Issues:**\r\n\r\n* #445 (original feature request). Here, I preferred to open a fresh new issue focused on the requirement definition of the `travis-build` android builder.\r\n* travis-ci/travis-worker#56 (linux 32bit/64bit compatibility issue)\r\n* travis-ci/travis-cookbooks#153 (for the android-sdk preinstallation on the build VM)\r\n\r\n**Examples of Android Projects:**\r\n\r\nThis proposal has been inspired from these examples:\r\n\r\n* Gradle: https://github.com/pestrada/android-tdd-playground/blob/master/.travis.yml\r\n* Maven: https://github.com/embarkmobile/android-maven-example/blob/master/.travis.yml\r\n* Ant: https://github.com/mixi-inc/Android-Device-Compatibility/blob/master/.travis.yml\r\n* Other Ant: https://github.com/leandog/brazenhead/blob/master/build.xml\r\n\r\n/cc @joshk @andrewhr @rkistner'

Specifically, if the tests depend on the secure environment variables, pull request tests will fail.\r\n\r\n I\'m opening this issue to discuss possible solutions to this problem. Some ways have already been proposed, for instance:\r\n\r\n- Restart jobs with pull requests [GH-1159]. We already have infrastructure in place for including information in a job config whether secure environment variables should be available, so this may be sort-of easy to implement\r\n- Have a list of "trusted users" who can run tests with secure environment variables. I feel like this is a duplication of the list of people who can commit to the repo, and that these users should just push to branches on the main repo instead. This is somewhat opinionated, though.\r\n- Allow multiple versions of the secure environment variables. For instance, for a given service say "if the test is run on the main repo, use this key. Otherwise, if it\'s run by @henrikhodne, use this key, or if it\'s run by johndoe, use this key, etc…\r\n- Add some way of generating an expiring key that can be made public, but will expire after a short amount of time (~1 hour) or when the build stops.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas, or any thoughts on the ideas above, please do write so below.

Compare to [this log](https://travis-ci.org/ksheedlo/angular.js/builds/9671424#L1324), with the exact same code in which the same script runs to completion.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue, we tried:\r\n\r\n* Reproducing/debugging the issue locally (we couldn't reproduce on Ubuntu)\r\n* Debugging on a Travis debug server (hostname `debug-sheedlo-angularjs-node-1375124938`) (we couldn't reproduce)\r\n* Enabling `--debug` and `--trace` in Grunt\r\n* Trapping in `./travis_grunt.sh` to see what was causing it to stop (trap never triggered)\r\n* Moving all of the scripts in `before_script` into a shell script in `script` (worked!)\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I am reasonably confident that the issue is not in `grunt` or `bower`, but with Travis. It seems like something outside the scope of our `before_script` is killing that particular command, but that's just a hunch.\r\n\r\nIf there's any more information I can provide to clarify the issue, let me know.

1192,'',"Reliability improvements for the worker\nAs last Monday's outage showed, our worker doesn't handle availability problems with the Boxpanel API very well. There are some things we should consider implementing.\r\n\r\nFirst problem is a low-hanging fruit, and it's increased visibility regarding problems and errors booting and connecting to VMs. We need more metrics to be tracked when a block can't be booted, and we need metrics to show when the worker can't connect to it. The latter is an indicator of problems rippling through the Blue Box infrastructure, where the servers themselves can't fully register with the Boxpanel API and therefore have no network connectivity.\r\n\r\nSecond problem is the increasing amount of traffic we cause on the API when things to awry. When we can't boot a block successfully because of an error, we currently requeue the message and try again with the next message immediately.\r\n\r\nAs errors increase we should throttle our number of requests in a way that still lets some trickle through so that we can see if there are still any problems. There's a gem for that called https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade, which can be used in conjunction with https://github.com/bitlove/rollout. Rollout itself doesn't necessarily need Redis anymore, so it could just run within the context of a process and track any errors.\r\n\r\nWith degrade we could track the number of boot requests and the errors returned. Degrade will eventually trip a circuit by marking a specific feature as degraded in rollout. We could, for instance, set a percentage of requests that's still allowed through, showing us if there are still any issues, but at the same time vastly reducing the traffic we'd cause against the Boxpanel API, reducing the snowball effect of too many API requests.\r\n\r\nThese changes are somewhat straight-forward and should not just protect our own code better, it should also reduce the ripple effect of our continued API usage when there's a problem with the code behind it."

The simple solution is to use apt-get for zlib and pip for PIL:\r\n\r\n    language: python\r\n    python: "3.2"\r\n    install: \r\n     - sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev\r\n     - pip install PIL --use-mirrors ; true\r\n    script: tests/alltests.py\r\n\r\nHowever, this fails because apt-get installs zlib1g in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so` where it is not found by pip. To correct for this, my install script looked like this:\r\n\r\n    language: python\r\n    python: "3.2"\r\n    install: \r\n     - sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev\r\n     - sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/\r\n     - pip install PIL --use-mirrors ; true\r\n    script: tests/alltests.py\r\n\r\nHowever, this feels like a hack, and sure enough, the path recently changed from `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libz.so` to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so`. Debugging this is clumsy (It involves temporary modifying the script to run `dpkg -L` instead of alltests.py, locate is not installed).\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to have pip recognize the relevant paths?'

1089,'',"Investigate network timeouts on our new build setup\nWhile we don't have specific numbers to back up all possible correlation, there are problems involving installation of dependencies that seem to have been increasing since we moved our infrastructure setup and more specifically, since we moved to IPv6.\r\n\r\nHere's what we know:\r\n\r\n- Increased number of timeouts installing RubyGems via Bundler. They appear as SSL connection timeouts.\r\n- Problems installing NPM dependencies. Talking to npmjs has brought up some strange issues, for one there have been problems parsing the returned JSON, suggesting that HTML is returned due to e.g. 40X or 50X pages being returned.\r\n- Problems cloning repositories from GitHub. There have been reports of clones timing out as well.\r\n- Problems fetching tarballs from GitHub using Composer. They seemingly time out after a while occasionally, leading to an empty response. This can be reproduced by hitting a specific tarball URL with wget, some requests take a lot longer, but on a build box, they time out quickly.\r\n\r\nWhile some parts could be narrowed down to problems with the dependency services (npmjs.org or rubygems.org SSL connectivity issues), others suggest that the network stack has much smaller network timeouts overall on our build boxes compared to e.g. my local machine, which could explain a lot of the issues we've been seeing.\r\n\r\nThis could be due to the tunneling of IPv4 requests through the IPv6 stack, and I'll open a ticket with Blue Box to discuss this possibility.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the possible network issues, there are some things worth looking into as mitigations:\r\n\r\n- Caching of dependencies: this is something worth looking into regardless. There is already a good amount of folks doing that, and how to do it is [public knowledge](http://randomerrata.com/post/45827813818/travis-s3). While this won't solve the overall problems, it will significantly reduce the amount of requests we'll send to dependency services, therefore reducing the overall chance of requests timing out. This could be a part of our standard build system.\r\n- Run local mirrors: for RubyGems, we could host our own redirect proxy, which redirects folks directly to S3 rather than hitting the rubygems.org servers. The downside is that people need to specify it as a source in their Gemfile. For pip, it's somewhat straight-forward, though for some reason, the common mirror scripts don't seem to mirror each and every package available on the main mirror.\r\n- Add retries to our build system: I started looking into adding retries to Bundler in particular, as we've seen network timeouts even when deploying on Heroku.

John Doe forks my project and does a bunch of work, but his readme points to my status icon, regardless of whether or not he has travis-ci setup. This can mean inaccurate information is displayed. This means that perhaps John will need to ignore certain parts when pushing/pulling and make use of filter-branch more frequently. \n\nSay for another example that I\'m a travis-ci zealot and I\'m telling a friend how helpful travis-ci can be for projects! I see his project sitting out on github and I think "I know! I\'ll just patch travis-ci support for him, and all he has to do is turn it on in the admin panel". If I send him a pull request, I have to either set up a hard address for him to pull (this can be further complicated if my friend is organization, and the person who turns on travis could be any admin member of the group).\n\nMy proposal is to expand the current controller that handles status images to accept a static route (perhaps travis-ci.org/status_img.png) and check the referer URL. If the URL doesn\'t exist or can\'t be linked to a travis user/repo - it reports unknown status. If it parses as a github repository and can be found as a linked repository, display the icon! That way forks can immediately reflect build status.\n\nThis could also be expanded to be more reliable. The current solution proposed could be unreliable if the client doesn\'t report referer url or if an outside site strips the readme for internal documents. In these cases, perhaps the github hooks api could be used to make travis aware of forks that exist/the network graph. This is only really necessary if the referer url proves to be too reliable.\n\nI tried to get help implementing this myself, but I just can\'t be bothered to learn rails 3 just to implement a 3-10 line pull request - I know it\'s this simple, but I haven\'t used rails in years so I can\'t figure out how. I\'ll donate $35USD to travis in the name of any person who helps me implement this - regardless of whether the pull request is accepted or not.'

Lets say I make an app, where if one environment fails, I don't care about the rest. Maybe I've made a syntax mistake, so I know the rest will fail. Who knows? But lets say that of my 12 configs, the first one fails. I should be able to cancel the rest of the tests. This would reduce Travis's serverload, as well as allow other queued items to go.\r\n2.

762,'','Feature Request: Skip Travis Testing Commit Header\nToday, I was guilty of clogging up the PHP testing queue for some time (and I do apologize). My problem is, if I want to do a commit to Github, the only way for me not to have it tested is to comment out my .travis.yml file. This, however, has 2 unintended side-effects:\n1. New pulls, pushes, and commits are not Travis tested\n2. I have to turn it back on, in a new commit, which then runs the tests I wanted to avoid.\n\nExample use-case: \nLets say, like today for me, I wanted to do some "rapid" dev, which entailed me pushing 6 commits within a 15-30 minute span. Lets further say, that I have a average to above average number of environment testcases.\n\nSo what happens right now, is that all commits get all of the tests queued. Thats great. Except that the only one I really cared about is the last one. While it might be convenient to just make Travis only test the most recent commit, I\'m sure theres a very valid reason for testing all of them. However, there should be a way to skip Travis testing on commits. \n\nTherefore I offer the following suggestion:\nWhen Travis gets a commit, before queuing it, make it parse the description of the commit for a string that looks like (with hashtag) #NoTravis (don\'t make it case-sensitive though, cause thats just annoying). Then, if a #NoTravis is detected, simply don\'t test it. That way, I now have an easy way, regardless of git client, to keep Travis from testing a commit.

The shell will error out on the \'if\' line when it sees "then" followed by a semicolon. Also, those echo commands won\'t work properly when embedded in an \'if\' statement -- even if this were syntactically valid code, if the database weren\'t pgsql, then what we\'d see in the log would just be\r\n\r\n    $ if [ "$DB" == "pgsql" ]; then\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nBasically the problem here is that net/ssh\'s approach requires that it parse shell, and you cannot parse shell (#494).\r\n\r\nSecond, this is all invisible to the user -- the log just shows something like\r\n\r\n    $ if [ "DB" == "pgsql" ]; then\r\n    bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;\'\r\n\r\nThis is extremely confusing -- notice that the semicolon that is causing the error is not actually even visible in the log! A workaround is to put these kinds of constructs all on one line with semicolons instead of newlines, but there\'s no way for someone to realize this just from looking at the log.\r\n\r\nSo in the short term, mentioning this in the documentation would be helpful.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, it would be nice if the code being executed actually matched what was in the .travis.yml file and was shown in the log, and if these kinds of constructs would work. This would require two changes, presumably in net/ssh: First, the echo commands would need to go away. They should be generated somehow within the client API. Second, a more reliable way is needed to detect the end of shell commands and extract the output status (which is what that DONTEVERUSETHIS gunk up there is for). I believe the proper way would be to force the shell into interactive mode (bash -i), and then do something like\r\n\r\n    PS1="<long random string> $? "\r\n    PS2="<long random string> INCOMPLETE "\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that when bash sees a complete command, it prints $PS1. If PS1 is set as per above, then we can easily recognize its presence in the output, and extract the command exit status from it. But, a line like \'if [ "$DB" == "pgsql" ]; then\' has no exit status -- in that case, bash prints $PS2. The above setting for PS2 will let us detect this condition, letting us know that it\'s time to feed bash the next line. This would be far simpler and more reliable than the current hack.'

Sadly, this is the version of Python that is still distributed in RHEL 5 (and CentOS 5, and Scientific Linux 5), which means that some people are still actually using it in enterprisey and academicy contexts. Therefore many projects are still keeping compatibility -- e.g., numpy just had an argument about this recently, and decided that they needed to maintain 2.4 compatibility for at least the next few releases; other popular projects like lxml (the most-downloaded package on PyPI) also continue to support 2.4.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, my project claims to support 2.4 too, which would be easier if my CI server could test it :-).\r\n\r\nMost of the basic required tools seem to have maintained python 2.4 compatibility: on my Ubuntu laptop, I just installed python2.4 from the Dead Snakes ppa, then created a python2.4 virtualenv and then used pip and distribute to install nose and mock. Everything worked perfectly, and nose\'s tests all passed.\r\n\r\nThe only entry in the "installed by default" list that failed to work is py.test, which uses the ternary operator introduced in python 2.5.

437,'henrikhodne',"travis-ci.org uses #! URLs but doesn't support _escaped_fragment_\ntravis-ci.org uses `#!` URLs, which implies that it supports [Google's Ajax Crawling Scheme](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started). However, travis-ci.org doesn't appear to support the `_escaped_fragment_` parameter that the Ajax Crawling Scheme requires. See Step 2 of the Ajax Crawling Scheme's Getting Started page linked above.\r\n\r\nFor example, the URL <http://travis-ci.org/#!/reid/yeti> should be equivalent to <http://travis-ci.org/?_escaped_fragment_=/reid/yeti> in order to allow Google to crawl the page. However, the `_escaped_fragment_` URL just returns the travis-ci home page, so that's all the Googlebot will ever index.\r\n\r\nProperly supporting the Ajax Crawling spec means travis-ci must be capable of rendering all URLs on the server for the sake of the Googlebot. This currently doesn't seem to be the case, so travis-ci's use of `#!` is actually incorrect, and it should be using `#` instead.\r\n"

For instance, [browserid](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid) has multiple different classes of branches:\r\n\r\n  * **development** - This is `dev` which is the current integration branch for new development - tests should always pass here\r\n  * **trains** - branches that have split off of dev, are in QA, and will roll into production once vetted.  Tests must always pass here - they are named `/^train-\\d{2}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}$/` (i.e. `train-2012.02.02`)\r\n  * **bugfix/feature** - branches that are in progress snapshots of development to fix an issue or implement a new feature - they are named `/^issue-\\d+$/` - tests must pass only when implementation is complete and a pull request is issued.\r\n  * **experimental/usertest** - branches that are exploring potential features, either in code or are sufficiently implemented to deploy and A/B test.  tests may or may not pass at the discretion of the developer.\r\n\r\n(you can [read a bunch more](http://lloyd.io/applying-gitflow) about our dev flow if you care)\r\n\r\nIf patterns were allows inside the `branches` specification, the following would support a branching model like this as it exists today:\r\n\r\n    branches:\r\n      only:\r\n        - dev\r\n        - /^train-.*/\r\n\r\nSome alternatives to baking this feature directly into travis would involve changes to our development flow:\r\n\r\n  1. manually update `.travis.yml` every time a train is forked to include that train\r\n  2. institute a convention that only branches with passing tests are allowed in the repository - that is feature branches ready for merge, the main integration branch (`dev`), and trains.  All other dev should occur in forks as a different user\r\n\r\nFor me, it seems like allowing patterns is a small and localized change that can make travis-ci work out of the box for more projects with different development flows.

415,'',"Show status image codes.\nI made some initial steps to resolve #381 and #404. I added main status image to the right of the repository name. Hovering over this image reveals form with branch selector and a number of fields (currently only two of them) that are refilled with proper url and mardown code when you select a branch. Mouse click on the input selects its content so all that left for user to do is to copy it. The whole block hides when you click anywhere outside of it. Here is how it looks (click for full-size image):\r\n\r\n[![Status image codes](http://i.minus.com/ibeQd9OQWBbHdP.png)](http://min.us/mUsGhrWlg#5o)\r\n\r\nI think there are several things that can be improved:\r\n\r\n* Hopefully someone will be pleasantly surprised when he reaches out for the status image to copy its link and get this form displayed, but when it's hidden there is no hint of its existence. I tried some arrow like button to the right of the image but it didn't look well. May be there should be some small text note though it might not fit nice into this place\r\n* The form is displayed on hover and is hidden on click (outside of it) that is a bit awkward. First I tried showing it on image's `mouseenter` and hiding on form's `mouseleave` but get into troubles with long list of branches. In that case select options list goes out of the box's boundary and click on the option that is outside triggers `mouseleave` on the box.\r\n* Looks like click on the repository in the list on the left of the page causes `repository.slug` to change multiple times that leads to at least two calls of `_updateGithubBranches` and as the result - two API calls to Github. Obviously, it's should be fixed but I'm not sure what is the best way to deal with that.\r\n* A couple of other popular formats like Textile or RDoc should be added.\r\n* Some things might be not in the right places as I'm still getting familiar with project's structure and ember.js architecture. Feel free to point such things out.\r\n* It lacks specs, but I don't know how to mock API calls in JS specs and not sure whether that should be view or controller specs.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any comments to the implementation and ideas of how to make this feature better.

Latest rvm provides built-in support for these patches: `rvm install 1.9.3-p0-falcon --patch falcon`.\r\n\r\nTravis can provide `1.9.3-falcon` ruby to test against. It will have several benefits. First of all it will provide an easy way to demonstrate how much these patches improve ruby performance by comparing time it took to complete tests on 1.9.3 and 1.9.3-falcon. Therefore it will provide wider adoption of these patches among rubyists and give incentive to ruby-core to react on redmine tickets. Secondly, by seeing improvement in test times people will switch their travis worker to run tests from 1.9.3 to 1.9.3-falcon leading to better utilization of cpu and ram.\r\n"

It would be great if `travis-ci` allowed users to performance test their applications.\r\n\r\nAs an example I'm building a [spell checker][spell] module for node. There's really not much to testing the functionality and interfaces are unlikely to ever change. The real important factor to test in a spell checker is speed. Namely how it evolves from version to version, and making sure that a pull request does not statistically degrade performance of the library, or proving that it actually improves performance in a statistically significant way.\r\n\r\nThis is how I see the workflow:\r\n\r\n* Either we choose a performance branch we test, or we test everytime a new tag (version) exists\r\n* When that is triggered we run tests. We need to make sure they compare to previous versions so we actually might need to run tests for all version everytime. Or maybe just the current version and previous one is enough.\r\n* If there is a statistically significant difference in performance in one (or more) methods than use should receive an email saying performance is worse. If the performance has actually increased user should be sent an email saying so too.\r\n* In the webpage we could have a up arrow, down arrow, equal sign to show the progression of the performance for this module\r\n\r\nI know this is super hard work and I really appreciate all the awesomeness that has gone into travis already. I just think this would be super useful to help the open-source community make better modules that work blazing fast.\r\n\r\n/cc @3rd-eden @mmalecki @isaacs\r\n\r\n[spell]: https://github.com/dscape/spell"

2978,'',"Add Perl6 support\nI'd like to volunteer to help with getting Perl6 added as a language supported by travis. Before going any further i'd like to make it clear that Perl6 is a completely different language from Perl5 with a almost completely different community. I bring this up because I don't think reallocating Perl5 resources for this is fair to the Perl5 community (i.e. dropping an older version of Perl5 due to adding Perl6).\r\n\r\nI understand the build time may be a concern. For Perl5 you are building 10 images, but Perl6 would only require 3 to 6 (for now): 3x the latest release (usually a monthly release) and 3x the latest build from source (daily/monthly) (The 3x references the 3 backends that Perl6 can currently be built on: MoarVM, JVM, and Parrot).\r\n\r\nBuild times for Perl6 on travis-ci:\r\n\r\n    MoarVM: 7 minutes\r\n    JVM: 44 minutes\r\n    Parrot: 30 minutes\r\n\r\nThese times were calculated from the following empty (with the Perl6 installation bits highlighted):\r\nhttps://github.com/ugexe/P6TCI/blob/master/.travis.yml#L18-L22\r\nwhich uses rakudobrew (like a basic version of the perlbrew you use for Perl5 builds) to build/install the perl6 compiler.\r\n\r\nMoarVM is the main VM tested against, is the fastest to build, and is what rakudo (a perl6 compiler) travis tests against: \r\nhttps://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/nom/.travis.yml\r\nwhich does not use rakudobrew and installs rakudo directly.\r\n\r\nThe JVM and Parrot, while super slow to build, would be nice to have in addition to MoarVM for discovering implementation differences/limits between the VMs. This is especially true for module authors who may not have the private resources available to test against all 3 VMs (like the Rakudo developers).\r\n\r\nIts worth noting that Perl6/Rakudo requires Perl5 to be installed. A single build of any somewhat modern version should suffice, including a binary."

2939,'','Feature request: caching objects downloaded by a git clone\nRecently I have been trying to set up a complex Travis build for some embedded software which needs to be compiled with a "Canadian" cross-compiler. This meant that as well as installing some dependencies with `apt-get` I also needed to install customised versions of tools like `gcc`, which have to be downloaded via a `git clone` and built. This is a long and wasteful process - much of the build time is spent dealing with dependencies, before the system under test can be downloaded (or cloned).\r\n\r\nCurrently, dependencies which are installed via `apt-get` can be cached. Complex environments, like the one described here, could be set up more efficiently by adding an option to cache some (or all) of the objects downloaded via a `git clone`. That would mean that, after caching, only the most recent deltas would need to be downloaded in future builds of the project under test. \r\n\r\nAnother way around this might be to create Docker image with the relevant toolchain built and installed. Then CI could be done on Travis by loading the Docker container and running CI tests inside the container (and perhaps caching the Docker container).'

2881,'','No method to distinguish COMMIT_RANGE from PR vs COMMIT_RANGE not from PR\nI may well be overlooking something obvious, but here\'s an expose of an annoying problem I had in case it helps someone.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use git to examine the changes that occurred during a build on master, you have to consider 3 different cases. As far as I can tell, Travis-CI provides no method to distinguish between the three cases, which means you cannot handle them all properly. \r\n\r\nHere is a comment from my change detection script explaining the issue\r\n\r\n        # Scenarios to consider\r\n        #  - 1 One non-merge commit pushed to master\r\n        #  - 2 One merge commit pushed to master (e.g. a PR was merged). \r\n        #      This is an example of merging a topic branch\r\n        #  - 3 Multiple commits pushed to master\r\n        # \r\n        #  1 and 2 are actually handled the same way, by showing the \r\n        #  changes being brought into to master when that one commit \r\n        #  was merged. Fairly simple, `git log -1 COMMIT`. To handle \r\n        #  the potential merge of a topic branch you also include \r\n        #  `--first-parent -m`. \r\n        #\r\n        #  3 needs to be handled by comparing all merge children for \r\n        #  the entire commit range. The best solution here would *not* \r\n        #  use --first-parent because there is no guarantee that it \r\n        #  reflects changes brought into master. Unfortunately we have\r\n        #  no good method inside Travis-CI to easily differentiate \r\n        #  scenario 1/2 from scenario 3, so I cannot handle them all \r\n        #  separately. 1/2 are the most common cases, 3 with a range \r\n        #  of non-merge commits is the next most common, and 3 with \r\n        #  a range including merge commits is the least common, so I \r\n        #  am choosing to make our Travis-CI setup potential not work \r\n        #  properly on the least common case by always using \r\n        #  --first-parent \r\n\r\n        # Handle case 3\r\n        # Note: Also handles case 2 because Travis-CI sets COMMIT_RANGE for \r\n        # merged PR commits\r\n        self.commit_range = "--first-parent -m %s" % os.environ[\'TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE\']\r\n\r\n        # Handle case 1\r\n        if self.commit_range == "":\r\n          self.commit_range = "--first-parent -m -1 %s" % os.environ[\'TRAVIS_COMMIT\']\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that there is no way to tell if `COMMIT_RANGE` was set because this is a PR merge, or if `COMMIT_RANGE` is set because this was a number of commits pushed to master at once. Perhaps there could be a helper variable like `TRAVIS_ORIGIN_PR: The pull request number if the current job resulted from merging a pull request`'
2878,'','Please consider disabling API documentation "warping" behaviour\nThe present API documentation has a very very annoying quirk in that as you\'re scrolling down the page, even a single segment, as soon as the heading for the next segment comes into view, the WHOLE segment warps to the top.\r\n\r\nWhich means to read any text at the bottom of some segments, you have to let it warp to the following segment, then scroll backwards to bring the bottom of the segment ( which is now *above* your screen ) back into view.\r\n\r\nThis is very frustrating when scrolling, or even just trying to read the documentation scanning for something relevant, and you get the feeling somebody is nannying you and saying "Hey, you\'re not smart enough to scroll a page on your own, let me show you how its done", or you have a toddler slapping your face with a fish repeatedly while you\'re just trying to read a book.\r\n\r\nWorse, when you scroll far enough for the "Lint" section to come into view, you can get perpetually stuck below that heading, as all attempts to scroll back up past it has it force you back down.\r\n\r\nIt is a seriously unpleasant effect and I found myself having to restrain myself with expressing exactly how frustrating that is =)\r\n\r\nRepeat:\r\n\r\n1.

When `Annotations > Attributes ` falls outside the viewport, the document hash changes, and the entire \'Accounts\' section is forcibly scrolled to the top so `Accounts` as the new screen top.\r\n\r\nNB. Although it appears that way on that heading on that case, it doesn\'t appear to be strictly heading related and I\'m not sure what is going on, but the effect seems to be a side effect of both each sections size in combination with screen size somehow.

Perhaps there are other scenarios in which people want to use Sauce Connect from Travis, and do not want Sauce to hit the Travis server, and in those cases the ondemand.saucelabs.com URL is correct? But certainly if you are setting up a web server on Travis, and want to run tests on Sauce against that server, then the URL you've got there is wrong as far as I know.\r\n\r\n> This is made more complicated by the fact that there seem to be many ways you can write the instructions for connecting to Sauce Labs, depending on the language you prefer to write in and your environment. We use se-interpreter and so this URL and port info lives in a .json configuration file in that case. As far as I know, the URL you would use for WebDriver does not change depending on the language you're using to connect, so since we found we have to use localhost:4445, that's why the example above seems misleading to me.\r\n\r\n> Also, since someone using Sauce Connect may very well want to run Sauce Connect to hit the Travis server, then it would be a good idea to link from that page to the various pages that explain how to setup different kinds of web servers on Travis. In our case, the Apache+PHP instructions were critical (they are on this page: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/php/ )"

2666,'','TRAVIS_COMMIT (and COMMIT_RANGE) bug for pull requests\nThis bug can basically be summed up as "if you\'re going to use the github automerge commit in `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` or `TRAVIS_COMMIT`, then you need to update these when starting each worker because the SHA of the automerge commit can change during a build". This only affects pull requests. \r\n\r\nI just found this bug on [this build](https://travis-ci.org/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/builds/32439965). You can see where jobs suddenly all turn green, which is not normal for us at the moment. Clicking into any job below 15 will show you the git errors caused by this bug. \r\n\r\nHere is a detailed breakdown of what\'s happening: \r\n\r\n* Open pull request 90. This triggers build `5`, uses auto-merge commit `cd9fec6`. The `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` is `5c627b7...cd9fec6`\r\n* During build `5`, add commits to PR 90. Github generates a new auto-merge commit `d3f5fe0`, and commit `cd9fec6` is lost forever\r\n* Jobs on build `5` continue to run, and travis will fetch the updated auto-merge commit of `d3f5fe0`. However, `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` will still refer to the old auto-merge of `5c627b7...cd9fec6`. Attempting to use this range will cause git problems, as the clone for this worker\'s clone has no commit `cd9fec6`\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the original merge commit appears to still exist on Github (proved by clicking the `Commit cd9fec6` link that Travis adds to the build description), but I don\'t know how long this holds true (e.g. forever, 5 days, 1 day?). \r\n\r\nTravis clearly already adds that specific merge commit to the build metadata, so to fix this you could either:\r\n* have Travis get that specific commit object from github instead of the general merge commit\r\n* Update the `TRAVIS_COMMIT` and `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` when starting each worker to ensure that they reflect the merge commit that you actually downloaded instead of the one that existed at the start of the build\r\n\r\nIn other threads I advocated for the `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` to include the github automerge commit by default. I now think that was a poor choice, because that automerge commit will never make it into the history of the project and is therefore an unreliable SHA for long-term use. A better solution would be only include the standard commits in the pull request, and leave the merge commit on FETCH_HEAD for anyone interested. \r\n'

2518,'','Add switch for "bundle clean" on "store build cache"\n### Background\r\nI\'m using multiple Gemfiles in one travis run, e.g. `./Gemfile`, `./folder_a/Gemfile` and `./folder_b/Gemfile`. To improve the speed of one run, caching for bundle install is advised. Using directory caching (see http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#With-a-custom-install-step ) this is already possible.\r\n\r\n### Limits to this approche\r\nSadly right before uploading the cache (`store build cache`), a `bundle clean` is executed. This means, that all gems, which are not listed in `./Gemfile` are removed from the bundle cache. So all gems from `./folder_a/Gemfile` and `./folder_b/Gemfile` which are not in `./Gemfile` are removed. This also implies, that all Gems from `folder_a` and `folder_b` need to be installed on every travis run, thus defeating the purpose of a cache.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nIt\'s possible to use two different bundle cache folders. One for `./Gemfile` and the other for all the other Gemfiles. This implies, that whenever something is called from `folder_a` or `folder_b` an additional `ENV` variable needs to be set.\r\n\r\nThis is cumbersome and error prune, since forgetting to set the correct `ENV`:\r\n* installing gems to the wrong cache and therefore being removed from the cache, once `bundle clean` will run\r\n* or `bundle exec` can not be executed, because the gems where installed into another cache folder.\r\n\r\n### Wish\r\nPlease provide a way to disable `bundle clean` during `store build cache`. This would allow me to use multiple Gemfiles, while using one cache folder.\r\n\r\nI understand, that `bundle clean` is there for a reason, to ensure, that the cache will not contain unneeded or obsolete files. But it\'s in our (the customers) interest to keep the cache folder small to improve the speed of a travis run. So a manual `travis cache --delete` once in awhile would be enough.'

2191,'','Proposal: travis-build integration testing (via Vagrant)\nI\'ve got a proposal for how to test scripts generated via travis-build on realistic worker environments.  This should help for developing adding Windows support.\r\n\r\nIf you want to jump right in, I created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/maxlinc/11051223) of how the final setup might work.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nThe truth is most of this is made possible by the awesome work @mitchellh has done on vagrant.  My proposal is just a Vagrantfile that takes advantage of the new [Vagrant Cloud]() and [Boxes 2.0](https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-5-boxes-2-0.html) features.\r\n\r\nThe way it works is by creating a Vagrantfile that defines three machines using three boxes:\r\n- travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\r\n- travis-ci/travis-worker-windows\r\n- travis-ci/travis-worker-osx\r\n\r\nThese images can take advantage of the Vagrant cloud for discoverability, multi-provider support, and updates.  We can generate build scripts by running travis-build on the host machine, and then using vagrant execute the scripts on the guests for each OS.\r\n\r\nSee below for more details on the workflow.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- Run generated scripts in realistic travis-worker environments (on all platforms)\r\n  - Workers environments are discoverable, updatable\r\n  - Worker environments can be made available on multiple virtualization platforms so contributors have their choice of local VMs or cloud machines\r\n  - Depend on images, not the travis-cookbooks/travis-images scripts, so we can "automate the second time we do it" for windows beta images\r\n- Does not require the full travis stack - in fact you probably don\'t even need the full travis worker, just the necessary pieces for a particular script (e.g. rvm)\r\n\r\nI like the continuous delivery recommendation to "automate the second time".  I think we should manually build a Windows image first, because:\r\n  - It will help the travis-cookbooks/travis-images projects discover what needs to be automated and what\'s *difficult* to automate on Windows\r\n  - It will make a beta image available for travis-build and travis-worker to start testing now, even before the chef/chocolatey/whatever automation is solved\r\n\r\n### Workflow\r\n\r\nThis will let you take the output of travis-build, and send it via vagrant (via ssh->bash for Linux, or winrm->powershell for Windows) to execute on a worker.\r\n\r\nThe details for adding and updating VMs is below.  We can build updated VMs from travis-images, and then pull them into travis-build for integration testing.\r\n\r\n#### Add the VM the first time\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant box add travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\r\n==> box: Loading metadata for box \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\'\r\n    box: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\r\n\r\nThis box can work with multiple providers! The providers that it\r\ncan work with are listed below. Please review the list and choose\r\nthe provider you will be working with.\r\n\r\n1) virtualbox\r\n2) vmware_desktop\r\n3) rackspace\r\n4) azure\r\n5) hyperv\r\n\r\nEnter your choice: 3\r\n==> box: Adding box \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\' (v1.0.0) for provider: rackspace\r\n    box: Download: https://vagrantcloud.com/chef/travis-ci/travis-worker-linux/version/1/provider/rackspace.box\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe\'d probably just start off with a few providers, but if travis-images moves switches to [packer](http://www.packer.io/) at some point, then it\'ll be easy to create "identical machine images for multiple platforms".\r\n\r\n#### Updating the VM\r\n\r\nThe Vagrant VMs are also updatable, so contributors to the travis-build project can be notified and get updates when new travis-worker images become available.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nvince@hashicorp: $ vagrant box update travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\r\n==> web: Checking for updates to \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\':\r\n    web: Version constraints: >= 0\r\n    web: Provider: rackspace\r\n==> web: Updating \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\' with provider \'rackspace\' from version\r\n==> web: \'1.0.0\' to \'1.0.1\'...\r\n==> web: Loading metadata for box \'https://vagrantcloud.com/travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\'\r\n==> web: Adding box \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\' (v1.0.1) for provider: virtualbox\r\n    web: Download: https://vagrantcloud.com/travis-ci/travis-worker-linux/version/2/provider/rackspace.box\r\n==> web: Successfully added box \'travis-ci/travis-worker-linux\' (v1.0.1) for \'rackspace\'!\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Running tests\r\n\r\nVagrant lets you send to a shell.  SSH is obviously supported to run bash, but he `vagrant-next` branch has been making progress for WinRM support cmd or powershell.  I\'ve successfully spiked using vagrant-rackspace/winrm/powershell from OSX with the `vagrant-next` branch.\r\n\r\nSo all we need to do is have travis build print a script for the desired platform, and then use Vagrant to send it to the target machine.  You can do this by putting a shell provisioner on each machine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n config.vm.define "windows" do |windows|\r\n    windows.vm.provision "shell", :inline => `travis run --print --target windows`\r\n    # ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut you could also just do it from the command line (which gives you more flexibility to run travis build for different projects).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant ssh linux -c `travis run --print`\r\n$ vagrant ssh windows -c `travis run --print --target windows`\r\n$ vagrant ssh osx -c `travis run --print --target osx`\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could also have the tests delivered to the travis-worker normally.  The reason I\'m a fan of just letting vagrant handle the shell is that it\'ll let us start testing PowerShell on Windows even before the travis-worker is fully working on Windows.  If you have a Windows machine with python installed, then you probably don\'t need the full travis worker to test a generated python build script.\r\n\r\n### Next steps\r\n\r\nIf that sounds good, how can we move forward?\r\n\r\n#### Linux images\r\nIt should be possible to create, publish, and start testing with travis-ci/travis-worker-linux images.\r\n\r\n#### OSX images\r\nIt might be possible to create travis-worker-osx images already as well, but there are fewer virtualization choices and possible more concerns about redistribution/licensing of customized OSX images.  Although I\'d like pre-built images (and the update mechanism that goes with it), it might be necessary to just spin up a vanilla OSX image and run the cookbooks :\\\r\n\r\n#### Windows images\r\nI don\'t think Windows support is there yet, but there may be enough experimental Windows support for some contributors to start playing around with images.\r\n\r\n##### Developing on Windows?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re running Windows locally, hyperv is probably your best bet.  Microsoft has a beta image available, but you probably can\'t redistribute customized travis-worker-windows image.  So an image may be possible, but not sharable....\r\n\r\n##### Developing on something else?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re running something else locally, there\'s a few options:\r\n  - vagrant-windows is probably the most complete and secure option, but there are no public images available.  You\'ll need to build your own image with your own windows license.\r\n   - You can also use Windows with Rackspace, AWS or other cloud providers if you install SSH and RSync on the Windows machines (usually via cygwin).  This is hacky, but may be less painful than buying a Windows license and your own Virtualbox images.\r\n  - I have a working spike of vagrant-rackspace using Windows/WinRM, but there isn\'t an official release.  The WinRM support I used is in the `vagrant-next` branch of vagrant.\r\n   - There is a vagrant-azure provider, but it\'s WIP and may not be usable yet.\r\n\r\nThoughts?'

If this is the case (I am not familiar with Windows development at all), we could either separate Windows cookbooks to not use the base recipe, or have another "shared" recipe for UNIX-like platforms.\r\n2.

1701,'','Travis working in "Detached Head\' mode can cause confusion if end users have git-oriented build processes\nPart of how travis executes branch testing means the state of git differs from the state of the git tree at the time the relevant commit was authored.\r\n\r\nThis specific issue is that travis operates trees in "detached head" mode, which means any tooling has to be aware of this, and know how to respond in kind, which isn\'t always straight forward ( and doing it wrong has confusing side effects ).\r\n\r\nFor a while, I was getting randomly occurring errors with "could not lock ref" errors, which seemed to randomly happen in batches for certain commits, but not others.\r\n\r\nAt its core, the issue is simply that travis does:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone --branch=$branch $repo\r\ngit checkout $sha1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich leaves the repository in a "detached head" state, which is notably different to how the state of the repository would have been when that commit was authored. ( And my tooling was simply not designed to work with building things in detached head conditions )\r\n\r\nI suggest that in order to get a closer approximation to the build environment, that travis instead does:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone --branch=$branch $repo\r\ngit reset --hard $sha1\r\n```\r\nWhich will locally roll back the pointer of $branch to point to $sha1, so that the test environment more closely matches that of the commit environment.\r\n\r\nThis will not solve the issue about auxiliary tags being visible on rebuilds, but that\'s a separate issue.  \r\n\r\n### Background on "could not lock ref"\r\nTo give context on why exactly the detached head condition is counter-productive for me, I\'ll give my example case:\r\n\r\n1. My build process on `master` generates an additional branch `build/master`.\r\n2. This is the case for all "source" branches, so for a source branch `foo`, the generated branch is `build/foo`.\r\n3. Git, in "detached head" state cannot determine a `current branch` , because by definition, in detached head, there is no current branch.\r\n4. Because of this, the "generated" branch for me was something obscure like "build/master~2", which caused git to fail with "could not lock ref". ( Which I expect is the case because "~2" is invalid at the end of a branch name )\r\n5. I have locally worked around the stated issue with a local script to force the state back to a sane branch condition: \r\nhttps://github.com/kentfredric/GraphViz2-Abstract-Node/commit/f00a68764afcf053595622f21b71d133be17b368#diff-0a2776b44a49c403f038b8d5a9b1fda2R14\r\n6. Though I don\'t know for sure how futureproof this strategy will be.\r\n\r\nHence, why I\'m suggesting a potential change.\r\n\r\nIf this solution is not applicable for all users, then it could be an option, and if not an option, hopefully this issue will serve as some kind of direction if anyone experiences similar "detached head" related issues. ( Which I\'d been having intermittently for several weeks before I realised what the cause might be )\r\n'

1014,'','Make :language a matrix key?\nThe following suggestion was sent to the mailinglist by William Fulton and I think it\'d make sense to make :language a matrix key ... which I believe should give this flexibility with little other changes required, no?\r\n\r\n+++\r\n\r\nI havn\'t had much success in getting the matrix of versions working for our needs. I am configuring swig which is a bit unusual as it can supports nearly all of the languages Travis does. SWIG is compiled via a C++ compiler, but as it generates wrappers of C/C++ code for multiple different scripting languages, we would like runtime tests for Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP etc etc. Ideally I would like to test each language individually so that the resulting Build Matrix would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJob     Duration     Finished     Compiler     Python     Jdk       Ruby     Env\r\n8.1     xxx          xxx          gcc          2.7        -         -        SWIGLANG=python\r\n8.2     xxx          xxx          gcc          3.3        -         -        SWIGLANG=python\r\n8.3     xxx          xxx          gcc          -          openjdk6  -        SWIGLANG=java\r\n8.4     xxx          xxx          gcc          -          openjdk7  -        SWIGLANG=java\r\n8.5     xxx          xxx          gcc          -          -         1.8.7    SWIGLANG=ruby\r\n8.6     xxx          xxx          gcc          -          -         1.9.3    SWIGLANG=ruby\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my experiments, I can\'t get any control over the version of the script languages. For example this simple .travis.yml file only provides Python 2.7 (the default) and not 3.3 in all 4 rows of the matrix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlanguage: cpp\r\ncompiler:\r\n  - gcc\r\n  - clang\r\npython:\r\n  - "2.7"\r\n  - "3.3"\r\nbefore_install:\r\n  - sudo apt-get install libboost-dev -qq\r\nscript: ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -s && make -k check-python-test-suite\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any easy way to control the versions of the different scripting languages for a C++ project? The only thing that seems might work is to \'sudo apt-get install xxx\' where xxx is the requisite language. If this is the only sensible way to proceed, I\'d like to piggy back off whatever Travis uses for the language versions supported. Is there a list/mapping of the debian package names for all the language versions supported by Travis at any given time?'

249,'',"Dependent builds\nAn awesome feature to have would be a way to specify project dependencies (or better yet infer them from the Gemfile/gemspec), so that when a project builds successfully, all it's dependents' (that travis knows about) are built too.\r\n\r\nThis is a feature we use in the DataMapper CI, where anytime dm-core passes, it executes a build for every other dependent gem."
239,'',"Handle Ant's JUnit XML formatted output from test/spec runs\nAnt's JUnit XML format is a standard output for almost every test framework, and can be read by many continuous integration systems, such as Hudson or Atlassian Bamboo:\r\n\r\n* [ci_reporter](https://github.com/nicksieger/ci_reporter) (Ruby / Rails)\r\n* [NodeUnit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) (Node.js)\r\n* [Jasmine](https://github.com/larrymyers/jasmine-reporters) (Javascript)\r\n* [Clojure.test](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.test-api.html#clojure.test.junit/with-junit-output) (Clojure)\r\n* ['PyUnit'](http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html) (Python)\r\n* [SimpleTest](http://www.simpletest.org/en/overview.html#features) (PHP)\r\n\r\nWe could start by handling the **[ci_reporter](https://github.com/nicksieger/ci_reporter)** gem, since a lot of projects on Travis CI are Ruby / Rails. `ci_reporter` provides formatters for Test::Unit, RSpec and Cucumber. If we assume that some projects will be configured to use `ci_reporter`, then we could just test for the presence of the XML output at the end of the test run, and handle it if it exists.\r\nAlternatively, we could detect the presence of a ruby test framework and inject `ci_reporter` into the project's Gemfile before running the test suite. This idea is possibly related to [the issue about generating a Gemfile](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/205), since they will both automatically alter the project's environment.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to store / notify which tests passed / failed, and include backtraces for each error, etc."
216,'',"Support Windows and OS X\nThis will have to be done in steps, so I might break this issue down as support gets closer. Eventually, I'd like to make it such that the yaml file has something like:\r\n\r\n    os:\r\n      :windowsxp\r\n      :osx\r\n      :linux\r\n\r\nOr whatever. So you can build on multiple operating systems as well as just Linux.\r\n\r\nThis has some interesting issues:\r\n\r\n1) licensing\r\n2) availablility\r\n3) combinatorial explosion of rubies and platforms"

151,'joshk','Collect ecosystem-wide compatibility statistics\nSince we track builds against JRuby, I think we should collect a list of JRuby-compatible libraries. Criteria I have in mind is "80% build success on JRuby". If we can provide a full list of libraries, I think this will be a unique resource for the JRuby community. I guess we can periodically publish it over at jruby.org.\r\n\r\nCC: @svenfuchs @ifesdjeen'
