However in Java7 it\'s possible to use "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" command line option to workaround the problems.\r\n\r\nHere\'s an example of a failure that showed up after Travis environment update was done:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/grails/grails-core/builds/33701876\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\nBad <init> method call from inside of a branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a workaroud I have added this to .travis.yml:\r\n```\r\nenv:\r\n   global:\r\n   - _JAVA_OPTIONS="-XX:-UseSplitVerifier"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should have pinned the oracle-java7-installer package to 7u60 version .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'

2709,'BanzaiMan','Provide PERL version with threads support\nWe have had a request for PERL version with threads support. There was a PR regarding this case travis-ci/travis-cookbooks#213 which was closed, because of the excessive disk space which would be taken by additional PERL installations. As @joshk mentioned, we could enable threads support only in some of the versions.\r\n\r\n/cc @BanzaiMan '
2656,'henrikhodne',"Rust's Cargo nightlies have changed URL\nCurrently all `language: rust` projects are being built with the `2014-07-29` version of Cargo (the Rust package manager) because the file downloaded by travis is no longer updated.\r\n\r\nThe URL of the Cargo nightly now contains the target triplet instead of just the O/S name."
2641,'henrikhodne','Incorrect OS X CI environment brew upgrade instructions\nThe [documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/#Environment-common-to-all-VM-images) about the OS X CI environment suggests using the following to keep packages up-to-date:\r\n\r\n    before_install:\r\n      - brew update\r\n      - brew outdated | grep -q <package-name> && brew upgrade <package-name>\r\n\r\nIt appears the build is stopped because grep exits with a non 0 code when <package-name> doesn\'t exist.

2640,'henrikhodne','Bundler args ignored when language is objective-c\nI use bundler to manage the ruby dependencies ([Cocoapods][]) of my iOS projects. One of my projects also uses [Shenzen][] which needs Nokogiri. In an attempt to speed up my travis builds I include shenzen in my Gemfile in a separate group and added `bundler_args: "--without development"` to my `.travis.yml`.

1522,'henrikhodne','Reorganizing the documentation site\nI\'ve been thinking about this for a little while, and I think it may be time for us to reorganize our documentation site a bit. To me it feels like the site has gotten new content added to it for a while without a clear structure to it, so it\'s confusing where exactly things are. Looking in the sidebar, I see everything from topics to guides/how-tos to "FAQs".\r\n\r\nHere\'s what I\'d like to propose: We have a few (maybe five) main sections, which is listed on the main page. When you enter one of the main sections, the sidebar lists the pages under that section (and maybe the "master" pages for the other sections). Here\'s what I think may be good sections:\r\n\r\n- “**Build configuration**”. Needs a different name, but this\'ll contain things like the different build stages, a note on YAML syntax, ignoring branches, encrypting variables, etc.\r\n- **Languages**. This will contain information relevant to different languages. I haven\'t decided whether this should have sub-sections or sub-pages, although I\'m leaning towards the latter. The page for Ruby would contain information on how to use the `rvm` setting, what Ruby versions are provided (maybe not *as* relevant for Ruby since we do auto-installing, but this transfers to other languages), what the default build commands are, how to use `bundle_opts`, etc.\r\n- **Build Environment**. This contains information on what is installed on the VMs. There should be a page near the top of the section with "common" things that are installed on *all* images. Under that we can have Linux and OS X, then each language. There will be some duplication here with regards to what language runtimes are installed, but I think we can live with that.\r\n- **Deployment**. This contains all the information for how to deploy. This is already fairly well organized on our current site, so not much needs to be done here. One thing I think should be done is collect all the common options to the "main" deployment page, such as "only deploy on this branch".\r\n- **Notifications**. This contains information on notifications. There should be a quick overview page and a page for each notification type.\r\n\r\nWith all this we should also add better linking between the pages. For example, in the deploy section we can link to the config encryption page instead of having to explain the encryption over again.\r\n\r\nI\'m not saying this is the best way to organize things, but I do think we need something better than just a long list of pages which is what the sidebar currently looks like.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote: I\'m not a big fan of FAQs. For some things they may be necessary, for example “common build failures”. In this case I think it is really important to have search, and this should really only be for thing where you\'re looking for a solution to a very specific error. If you\'re reading up on deployment and trying to find out if it\'s possible to restrict deployment to a single branch, looking for “How do I restrict deployment to a single branch?” is not very helpful. I think we\'re doing pretty well with this so far, so I think we can more or less keep going like we are here.'

Specifically, if the tests depend on the secure environment variables, pull request tests will fail.\r\n\r\n I\'m opening this issue to discuss possible solutions to this problem. Some ways have already been proposed, for instance:\r\n\r\n- Restart jobs with pull requests [GH-1159]. We already have infrastructure in place for including information in a job config whether secure environment variables should be available, so this may be sort-of easy to implement\r\n- Have a list of "trusted users" who can run tests with secure environment variables. I feel like this is a duplication of the list of people who can commit to the repo, and that these users should just push to branches on the main repo instead. This is somewhat opinionated, though.\r\n- Allow multiple versions of the secure environment variables. For instance, for a given service say "if the test is run on the main repo, use this key. Otherwise, if it\'s run by @henrikhodne, use this key, or if it\'s run by johndoe, use this key, etc…\r\n- Add some way of generating an expiring key that can be made public, but will expire after a short amount of time (~1 hour) or when the build stops.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other ideas, or any thoughts on the ideas above, please do write so below.

Rather, I want all of my stuff (code, tests, demos, docs, etc.) to be auto-hosted via my "gh-pages" project pages, so I only rely on the "gh-pages" as my main codebase — if I didn\'t, I would need to have a bunch of unnecessary pre-commit hooks in order to ensure all of the important pieces from the "master" branch got copied into their appropriate corresponding spot in the "gh-pages" branch for hosting.\r\n\r\nHowever, after creating a ".travis.yml" file and verifying the service hook settings, my attempts to both "Test Hook" and trigger via push did not work.

URLs but doesn't support _escaped_fragment_\ntravis-ci.org uses `#!` URLs, which implies that it supports [Google's Ajax Crawling Scheme](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started). However, travis-ci.org doesn't appear to support the `_escaped_fragment_` parameter that the Ajax Crawling Scheme requires. See Step 2 of the Ajax Crawling Scheme's Getting Started page linked above.\r\n\r\nFor example, the URL <http://travis-ci.org/#!/reid/yeti> should be equivalent to <http://travis-ci.org/?_escaped_fragment_=/reid/yeti> in order to allow Google to crawl the page. However, the `_escaped_fragment_` URL just returns the travis-ci home page, so that's all the Googlebot will ever index.\r\n\r\nProperly supporting the Ajax Crawling spec means travis-ci must be capable of rendering all URLs on the server for the sake of the Googlebot.

For instance, [browserid](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid) has multiple different classes of branches:\r\n\r\n  * **development** - This is `dev` which is the current integration branch for new development - tests should always pass here\r\n  * **trains** - branches that have split off of dev, are in QA, and will roll into production once vetted.  Tests must always pass here - they are named `/^train-\\d{2}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}$/` (i.e. `train-2012.02.02`)\r\n  * **bugfix/feature** - branches that are in progress snapshots of development to fix an issue or implement a new feature - they are named `/^issue-\\d+$/` - tests must pass only when implementation is complete and a pull request is issued.\r\n  * **experimental/usertest** - branches that are exploring potential features, either in code or are sufficiently implemented to deploy and A/B test.  tests may or may not pass at the discretion of the developer.\r\n\r\n(you can [read a bunch more](http://lloyd.io/applying-gitflow) about our dev flow if you care)\r\n\r\nIf patterns were allows inside the `branches` specification, the following would support a branching model like this as it exists today:\r\n\r\n    branches:\r\n      only:\r\n        - dev\r\n        - /^train-.*/\r\n\r\nSome alternatives to baking this feature directly into travis would involve changes to our development flow:\r\n\r\n  1. manually update `.travis.yml` every time a train is forked to include that train\r\n  2. institute a convention that only branches with passing tests are allowed in the repository - that is feature branches ready for merge, the main integration branch (`dev`), and trains.  All other dev should occur in forks as a different user\r\n\r\nFor me, it seems like allowing patterns is a small and localized change that can make travis-ci work out of the box for more projects with different development flows.
