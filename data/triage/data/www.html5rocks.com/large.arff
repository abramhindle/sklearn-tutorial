I added a few new features and publish it here (in GitHub). I'm thinking about writing an article explaining why I did it and how I'm currently using it. \r\n\r\n### Here is a short info about the extension:\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to control processes that are usually run via the command line. Like for example Node.js applications. I have tons of these and it was really annoying switching back and forth between the browser and the terminal. The extension can run command line programs and returns their output. Like on the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n![Yez!](http://work.krasimirtsonev.com/git/yez/yez-screenshot-5.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt uses a Node.js module and communicates with it via websockets. At some point I realized that I can implement methods like loading a new page, opening a new tab or even running JavaScript inside the content of the current page. For example:\r\n\r\n![Yez!](http://work.krasimirtsonev.com/git/yez/yez-screenshot-3.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe fact that we can stop the process and run it again means that we don't have to go the terminal. And because we are able to add as many commands as we want we may end up with complex task which consist several operations.\r\n\r\nWhat you think?"

It exists, it is a thing, but it is a hack. Please don\'t use it.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a pretty simple method, the page loads and the browser bar is told to get out of the way. Unfortunately it is not standardised and not well supported. You also have to work around a bunch of quirks. For example browsers often restore the position on the page when the user navigates back to it. Using <code>window.scrollTo</code> overrides this, which annoys the user. To work around this you have to store the last position in localStorage, and deal with the edge cases (for example, if the user has the page open in multiple windows).\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nand I wholeheartedly agree.

614,'','Improve Table of Contents UX on mobile\nWhile browsing one of the recent articles on a mobile device I found the Table of Contents menu really frustrating. I had a really hard time trying to figure out how to close it without selecting any of the links, and it seemed like sometimes clicking a link would load the right section but other times it would not, and instead the menu would simply disappear. \r\n\r\nI\'ve taken a look at the code and worked on trying to make some simple usability improvements in the areas I felt it were problematic.\r\n\r\nHere\'s a summary of the changes I\'ve made:\r\n\r\n1) **Added an explicit "Close Menu" button to the bottom of the TOC.**\r\n\r\nThis gives the user a clear way to "get back" to what they were doing before, without loosing their current location in the document. The "Close Menu" button is now the only way to close the menu. Previously the menu could be closed by tapping anywhere on the background of the menu that wasn\'t a deep link, however there was no indication to the user that this was possible. It also meant that mis-tapping a deep link would close the menu (and not navigate to the section they tried to tap) thus causing greater confusion.\r\n\r\n2) **Made parts of the menu use touch events instead of the delayed synthesised click event.**\r\n\r\nThis was done to try and improve the responsiveness of the menu by avoiding the ~300ms delay of synthesised click events. I still feel there\'s some work to do in this area to make it feel perfect. (TODO: Need to profile).\r\n\r\n3) **Prevented the main document scrolling when scrolling past the bounds of the TOC where possible.**\r\n\r\nWhen scrolling to the top or bottom of the TOC the scroll behaviour propagates up to the html/body element when it reaches the bounds of the overflow: auto; container. this means that it was previous possible to be scrolling the main document behind the TOC while the TOC appeared stationary. I\'ve mitigated this where possible by setting overflow: hidden; on the html/body element when the menu is shown and removing this rule when the menu is dismissed. This works well in most situations but there is still one issue I discovered in iOS7 caused by the disappearing tab bar. Not sure if this is a Mobile Safari specific problem but I couldn\'t replicate it on Android.\r\n\r\n4) **Made the hit areas for the section links in the TOC larger, and removed the dead spacing between them.**\r\n\r\nThere is now no tappable gap between items. This means section titles are much easier to hit reliably.\r\n\r\n5) **Gave the section title links an "active" state.**\r\n\r\nThis was done to provide at least some instant feedback to the user that the device has registered their action. There still feels like an unnecessary delay between tapping a title and the menu closing and showing that section but I\'ve yet to profile it to find the exact cause. The active state slightly highlights the tapped item with a slightly lighter background colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n6) **Made it easier to differentiate between TOC entries by adding dividers.**\r\n \r\nI found it hard to distinguish between one item and the next in the table of contents when some of the section headings span onto multiple lines. I experimented with zebra-striped backgrounds for the list items but it didn\'t look great when the TOC was long enough to trigger the scrollbar. Open to other suggestions but using dividers seems like a pretty good improvement for now.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\nI\'d like to get your thoughts on the changes implemented so far. I feel like the TOC still isn\'t perfect but I believe the adjustments I\'ve made above improve the usability of this menu considerably.\r\n\r\nI\'m new to the codebase and while I\'ve checked as much as I can I may have missed something I\'ve inadvertently broken during development of these enhancements. I\'d welcome any pointers or advice that others may be able to provide regarding what else may need to be done or checked before others are happy with the suggestions.\r\n\r\nI\'d also like to fix/improve the menu transition. In the current html5rocks/master it\'s supposed to use a CSS transition on the `top` property but it just "appears" on mobile with no visible transition. I assume this is because the (paint/layout)? cost is too high for mobile devices to animate smoothly. Looking at doing something with transitioning a CSS transform instead at some point in the future but would need to actually do some digging to find the current issue.\r\n\r\n**Preview Screenshot:**\r\n \r\n![screen shot 2013-09-23 at 20 07 18](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/868834/1194356/b639c0fe-2483-11e3-81a4-cc194af1fd8d.png)\r\n\r\n**Preview Video on an actual device:**\r\n\r\n[http://cl.ly/0o3J0q2A230o](http://cl.ly/0o3J0q2A230o)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing thoughts and feedback.

Either way I updated the images anyway just in case. \r\n\r\nI\'ve tried to keep the image file sizes as close to the previous version as possible, but jpeg compression ontop of jpeg compression gets to look kind of bad.

HTML5rocks is a great help for developers, but geeks-that-do-not-code are left out. Urbini allows users to fork existing apps, tweak their [MVC] models in a smartphone browser and publish. How many geeks are there who can't code? I think a lot, may be 100M. Imagine that many people building HTML5 apps on their phone and tablets. \r\n\r\n## Apps by everyone, y tu mama tambien\r\n* Published app features social login for main social networks, FB Timeline integration, friend invite, profile, push notifications, gamification, wiki-style data editing, search, and lots more. Library of addons provides local, maps, virtual currency, p2p, b2c commerce, etc. \r\n\r\n* Urbini extended requirejs AMD loader with a mix of appchache, LocalStorage, and dynamic asset bundles. It makes offline support, versioning and upgrades of models, views, templates, css, third-party libraries, images and fonts totally hidden from the app maker. \r\n\r\n* Urbini makes offline apps work by painting from IndexedDB or WebSQL. Local DB auto sync with the cloud database and auto-conflict resolution requires zero effort from the app maker.\r\n\r\n* Urbini builds UI 100% automatically from the user-defined models. It employs for that Jquery Mobile with a set of OSS plugins/widgets and backbonejs. Urbini will allow to choose between JQM and Twitter Bootstrap in the future.\r\n\r\n## App network, all together now\r\nYet, Urbini's most important capability is that the final app is able to work together with other apps, using a shared graph. Sharing between apps requires no API and allows to copy-paste [MVC] models to exchange data between apps, in a style somewhat resembling IFTTT. What does this mean for the future of apps? Facebook demonstrated that a shared cloud database makes for a much simpler third-party app creation and information dissemination. But Facebook allows only a limited amount of built-in types. Urbien, company behind Urbini, created a similar graph of unlimited custom types, [Mary Meeker from KPCB thinks it is a big deal](http://www.slideshare.net/kleinerperkins/2012-kpcb-internet-trends-yearend-update/55). \r\n\r\nSee sample Urbini apps, screenshots and live demo on [Urbien](http://urbien.com)."

The angles represent the rotation between the local earth frame and the device frame. To align the device frame with the local earth frame, the phone must not only be on a horizontal surface, but the positive y axis must point north. Describing rotations from the 'normal position' is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n- 'An easier way to think about it is how much the device is tilted side-to-side, usually referred to as beta.' Beta measures rotation about the x axis, ie front-to-back 'pitch'. Side-to-side 'roll' is measured by gamma, which gives rotation about the y axis, as you show in the diagram above.\r\n\r\n- Diagram 'The phone is rotated on the Y-Axis by gamma degrees.' This is confusing because it looks like the y axis isn't aligned with the long axis of the device. Also, it would be good to show the direction of positive gamma, which is positive (using the right-hand-rule) rotation about the y axis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/#toc-deviceorientation\r\n\r\n- 'The device orientation event returns only the rotation data, which includes how much the device is leaning side-to-side (beta), front-to-back (gamma)'. As above, side-to-side is gamma, front-to-back is beta.\r\n\r\n- The four figures are very confusing to me. In the first two cases, if the device is on a 'flat' (I assume you mean horizontal) surface, surely the viewer must be looking down (albeit with north at the top of their field of view), not north? In the second figure, the text should be upside-down (rotated about a vertical axis), not flipped left-right (rotated about a horizontal north-south axis). In the third figure, are you trying to show the device with its screen in a vertical plane, but with the top of the screen leaning towards the viewer's right? If so, this should be {beta: 45, gamma: 90}. In general, I think it would be helpful to use more precise terminology, rather than 'facing' and 'pointing'.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/#toc-devicemotion\r\n\r\n- In the tables, 'Accelerating left' should be 'Accelerating right'.

280,'','A Voice & Text Story - a new type of Internet Media\nA Voice & Text Story is a new type of Internet media that takes advantage of the audio element in the latest Html 5 specification. A voice recording of a written text and the text itself are synchronized to one integrated multimedia, where the sound and the text is presented at the same time. The displayed text grows phrase by phrase following the natural pauses in the speech. If the control knob on the audio element is moved backwards to rewind the sound, then the displayed text also decreases to preserve a synchronized playback position for both sound and text. The displayed text may contain optional definitions, which are created as “hot” words that are defined when clicked.\r\n\r\nVoice & Text Stories are typically used for language training. Learning Spanish is one good example, where you need much exercise to be able to follow a native speaker. Spanish is known for its amount of fast spoken syllables, and it is easy to get frustrated as a beginner. You need to have access to both speech and written text to get over the first and often high threshold in Spanish learning. An integrated Voice & Text Story with full control over voice and text presentation is here an ultimate solution.\r\n\r\nThe Voice & Text media page is based on the audio element in the Html 5 specification with an add-on text player, that I have developed. It is very easy to use this add-on. Just insert the text to display between the two audio-tags together with a script tag that includes the JavaScript text player. The original text paragraph should be divided into synchronization phrases with one phrase per line. The player has a built-in timestamp function for synchronization. The voice recording is played back with half the normal speech rate. The time stamping is done by clicking the next phrase during the pauses in the speech.\r\n\r\nA working sample of a Voice & Text Story in Spanish may be found here: “La princesa y el guisante”. Please note that the script is developed for the reliable Google Chrome platform, and not yet tested for other browsers.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nThomas Börjeson\r\nwww.thomasb.eu\r\nthomas.borjeson@telia.com \r\n+46 303 726700'

At least one browser, Opera (as of 11.x), supports the ```.slice()``` method without a vendor prefix, and as such throws an error with the current code, which does not support the unprefixed ```.slice()``` method.\n\nTo fix this, I would recommend the following code example...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    }\n\n...be changed to...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else {\n        var blob = file.slice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    }\n\n...and this code example...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    }\n\n...be changed to...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else {\n        var blob = file.slice(start,stop+1);\n    }\n\nThe latter code example also appears in a compressed form as part of the page\'s actual executed code.\n\nThis will check for support for vendor prefixes first, as the article currently does, but will fall back to the non-prefixed ```.slice()``` specification if they\'re not supported.'

Because of this, some of the video + canvas demos\n    \n     at http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/ don't work.\n    \n    To reproduce, using Opera or Opera Next,\n    1) go to http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/\n    2) navigate to demo below the &quot;The only reason we are using two canvases is because the performance is much better than using a single one which imports the images and transforms at the same time.&quot; sentence, the second example in 5.4. VIDEO + CANVAS.\n    3) click play on the video on the left\n    \n    Expected Behavior:\n    The other two videos should start.\n    \n    Actual Behavior:\n    They don't. If you click play a second time, it works.\n    \n    <b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n    \n    This seems like a site bug, rather than an Opera bug. The specification does not say what the default value of the preload attribute should be, but recommends &quot;metadata&quot; ( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/video.html#attr-media-preload ):\n    The attribute's missing value default is user-agent defined, though the Metadata state is suggested as a compromise between reducing server load and providing an optimal user experience.\n    \n    And as for the event &quot;canplay&quot;:\n    If the previous ready state was HAVE_CURRENT_DATA or less, and the new ready state is HAVE_FUTURE_DATA\n    \n    The user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event named canplay.\n    \n    And state &quot;HAVE_FUTURE_DATA&quot;:\n    HAVE_FUTURE_DATA (numeric value 3)\n    Data for the immediate current playback position is available, as well as enough data for the user agent to advance the current playback position in the direction of playback at least a little without immediately reverting to the HAVE_METADATA state. For example, in video this corresponds to the user agent having data for at least the current frame and the next frame. The user agent cannot be in this state if playback has ended, as the current playback position can never advance in this case.\n    \n    Since the &quot;metadata&quot; preload value will not cause loading enough data to start playback, and it does not even force the browser to load the next frame, we never reach HAVE_FUTURE_DATA state and canplay event is never fired:\n    \n    metadata \tMetadata Hints to the user agent that the author does not expect the user to need the media resource, but that fetching the resource metadata (dimensions, first frame, track list, duration, etc) is reasonable.\n    \n    The fix is pretty easy, though:\n    \n    Just add preload=&quot;auto&quot; to the video element, e.g., <video poster=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/star.png&quot; id=&quot;video-canvas-fancy&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; controls>\n    \n    Alternately, wrap the code of processEffectFrame() with: if (ctx_copy) {...}\n"

It could actually mention both, to stress that no matter the source and the language used to represent the data (HTML/CSS vs SVG[/CSS]), embracing a higher separation between the view (using templates, and now moved entirely to the HTML files) and the controller brings several advantages:\r\n1) A cleaner result, easier to maintain and update;\r\n2) A more intuitive way of coding charts, which in turn cuts down the time required for development;\r\n3) Better performance, thanks to clever implementation of animations and event handling in Ractive.\r\n\r\nYou can take a look at a post I have already published on my blog about Ractive + Paths for data visualization: http://mlarocca.github.io/01-22-2014/pathsjs_ractive.html\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMarcello\r\n\r\nP.S.: the beginning of the article could look like this:\r\n\r\n# Data-driven visualization with Ractive.js\r\n## Creating MVC-compliant visualizations using a template-driven JavaScript library\r\n\r\nAs the amount of data produced and made available on the web by social interactions and ecommerce grows larger and larger, structuring and visualizing these data in meaningful (and human-friendly) ways becomes increasingly crucial.\r\n\r\nA new category of data-driven applications have, indeed, emerged during the last few years, and so it is for new technologies, patterns and frameworks support this new model.\r\nDuring the last year or so, in particular, a number of framework have arisen to support a better MVC compliance and therefore a better design of one-page applications: Angular, React, Ractive, etc....\r\nAll of these frameworks turn out to be a very good fit for data-visualization, both as SVG charts (using, f.i., [PathsJs](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js) or [n3-charts](https://github.com/n3-charts)) and as HTML5 rich visualizations.\r\n\r\nIn this post we are going to introduce Ractive.js, a template-driven library, and show how to use it to create an application to monitor a set of resources, refreshing the visualization every time an update is received from the server.\r\nThe application in the example, in particular, will have an interface that shows a laptop's battery status and a list of the Wi-Fi connections available.\r\n[As an alternative, an application with some sort of chart built with Ractive and PathsJs  could be chosen instead]"

Precompiled templates still work.\r\n\r\n* Reporting is broken, but getting better: as long as browser extensions trigger false positives of JavaScript violations (LastPass and Awesome New Tab Page, in our case), your e-mail inbox will be spammed. This will eventually be fixed, which leaves the other problem (extensions being used to spam or inject malware) unresolved.\r\n\r\nIf it\'s of interest for HTML5Rocks I would be glad to elaborate.'

895,'',"Web Synchronization Concept\nNew HTML5 allow create Web Synchronization Concept (WSC) based on idea of rendering HTML Page in browser but not on server side.\r\n\r\nImagine every device surf internet download whole web site once visit it and than just update it using different source mirrors. This will allow check news offline, place orders in web shop offline, less than a second web pages download, download web page from other resources automatically if original one not responding and etc. Many of these features depends on implementation of concept, let's see what is it about!\r\n\r\nMain idea to put smart script on client side (browser) with configuration information to download whole website or relevant part of site. Currently most of web pages rendering on server side and than transmitted in client side, this Web Synchronization concept offers do it vice versa. Server provide to client side objects (object model we have on server side, but this need to be used in browser via javascript), pages templates, sitemap, content files and database dump. After downloading all necessary information show page by rendering it from offline (cache, local database, local storage) using cache manifest file from server side. Configuration file may contain mirrors information to download page even if main source not available. Once this information was properly accepted, browser replace links to re-render after hyperlink click. This re-rendering will take less than a second if whole content for requested page was already downloaded. Prioritization and  limitation of downloads (local storage, database) is an issue, this is a weak place in concept currently but even now limits are flexible and can be extended by request to user.\r\n\r\n![wsc](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6362416/1881093/a29a9f94-7962-11e3-8e4f-dbb324176286.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a regular Web Synchronized Page (WSP) once you request it and server send you prioritized information to render requested page. After rendering first page browser already have full structure of objects, database, most of templates images (that can be reused), config file with mirrors and this web page based on manifest will stay in browser forever as a loader. Need to show WSP visitor progress bar of downloading rest content of WSPs and this progress must be managed by visitor: stop synchronization, increase browser limit to download full Web Synchronized Site (WSS). By default WSS must take full free space to place content, may happened that space will be not enough and developers need to think how this will work in limited space.\r\n\r\nDatabase on server side need to have special tables for synchronization, because not all information need to be synchronized with browser. All content which is sent to browser must be based on rules of semantic web. Very important to have distribution rules inside each content container (commerce, limited, public non distributable, public limited distribution, public free distribution). \r\nFinally content object may have structure like:\r\n- About object\r\n-- Title\r\n-- Description\r\n-- Language (title and deacription)\r\n- Classification\r\n-- Type (object, string, number, text, boolean, null, file)\r\n-- Where can be stored (server, server and browser)\r\n-- Store type (file, database record)\r\n- Copyright\r\n-- Author\r\n-- Publisher\r\n-- Distribution type (commerce, limited, public non distributable, public limited distribution, public free distribution)\r\n- Source\r\n-- Initial\r\n-- Additional\r\n- Identification\r\n-- Date\r\n-- Version\r\n-- Local ID\r\n-- Global ID\r\n- Methods (starts with init() by default)\r\n- Child objects\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn future will appear cloud mirror services to create additional sources (mirrors) for WSS as a part of regular hosting services."

However after talking to Addy, I found out folks may be looking into making page weight smaller for H5R, this affects video animations which are typically large in size.\r\n\r\nNot all digests will contain animations, some may have none, some could have many, either way, it might be nice to have some guidelines on allowed page weight per article.\r\n\r\nWith the gifs I\'ve created in the past, one animation can easily add up to 2-3mb. To keep this file size down, we can use the "packed images" technique: http://umaar.github.io/packed-images/ where that same animation could get to 400kb (including the fairly large chunk of JavaScript required to animate the images onto a canvas). Please have a look at the URL above and the JavaScript that the page uses, could we include this as an external JavaScript file on H5R articles?\r\n\r\nThinking about page weight and animations, I\'m _guessing_ a fairly high number of visits come from users who wouldn\'t mind downloading the extra data (for example, those on a fast & unlimited data plan). What about turning animations off by default but including an "Enable animations" button at the top of an article which tells the reader the total file size of the download should they wish to enable it.

One of the fun little additions we\'ve added is support for the [HTML5 Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/). Reading button presses off an Xbox 360 controller was easy enough; but then we just had to ask **"What About Force Feedback? It\'s been in controllers since the 90\'s. Right?"**\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of emails to the editors of the Gamepad API demanding to know where our precious rumble pak was, [Scott Graham](http://www.h4ck3r.net) got in touch, saying the feature had been *"lightly discussed"* in the early days of the Gamepad API, and has since now taken a form of it\'s own: **The Vibration API**\r\n\r\n### And we were like... ###\r\n\r\n![tumblr_mhu3981PA71s4woeho1_400](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1294877/165114/ae06fe58-7919-11e2-8c66-c865e94bbb16.jpeg)\r\n\r\n## Say Hi to the HTML5 Vibration API ##\r\n\r\nThe Vibration API is one of few API specifically intended with gaming in mind. In contrast with the Gamepad API however, which is slowly building up a wider user base, many people I\'ve spoken to, not to mention many documentation sources, didn\'t get the memo about also being able to make those gamepads wiggle.\r\n\r\nIt is logical however to keep the two API\'s separate however. Devices like the original Xperia Play come with their own gamepad and thumbsticks, it does not however have vibrating motors intended for gaming.\r\n\r\n## What I\'d Like To Do ##\r\n\r\nI\'d like to write a tutorial to get people up and running with the Vibration API. It\'s not the biggest, most complicated API in the world, but I feel it\'s the missing part of the Gamepad API that a lot of people aren\'t aware of. The biggest impact I think it can have is in getting the ball rolling with discussion on how the API can be improved on. The core topics being discussed in the tutorial would be:\r\n\r\n* A high level **overview** of what the Vibration API does \r\n* What browsers currently **support** the API\r\n* What **devices** should be used with Vibration\r\n* A cross-browser friendly **method** of using Vibration in games and web apps\r\n* Understanding how **vibration patterns** work\r\n* Using patterns to create different types of **rumble effects** (with examples, of course)\r\n* Some **limitations** to bear in mind\r\n* What the **future** might hold for Vibration\r\n\r\n## What I\'m Also Going To Do ##\r\n\r\nI\'m going to address some awareness issues on projects like HTML5 Please, which doesn\'t yet list the API yet. \r\nModernizr added support for detecting Vibration support in 2.6, which I\'d like to use in my tutorial in a similar way to the [Gamepad API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/) tutorial by Marcin Wichary.\r\n\r\n### May The Force (Feedback) Be With You ###'
