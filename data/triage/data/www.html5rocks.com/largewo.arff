755,'paullewis','Update templates not to scroll back to top if a user stared scroll down before onload\nOn the [mobile fullscreen article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/fullscreen/#toc-faking) I see:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>You can "fake fullscreen" by auto-hiding the address bar as follows:</p>\r\n<pre>window.scrollTo(0,1);</pre>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI am telling you this as a friend.  It exists, it is a thing, but it is a hack. Please don\'t use it.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a pretty simple method, the page loads and the browser bar is told to get out of the way. Unfortunately it is not standardised and not well supported. You also have to work around a bunch of quirks. For example browsers often restore the position on the page when the user navigates back to it. Using <code>window.scrollTo</code> overrides this, which annoys the user. To work around this you have to store the last position in localStorage, and deal with the edge cases (for example, if the user has the page open in multiple windows).\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nand I wholeheartedly agree. So let\'s update [templates/base.html](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/blob/master/templates/base.html#L356-361) and [templates/home-base.html](https://github.com/html5rocks/www.html5rocks.com/blob/master/templates/home-base.html#L96-101) not to annoy users ;)'

The angles represent the rotation between the local earth frame and the device frame. To align the device frame with the local earth frame, the phone must not only be on a horizontal surface, but the positive y axis must point north. Describing rotations from the 'normal position' is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n- 'An easier way to think about it is how much the device is tilted side-to-side, usually referred to as beta.' Beta measures rotation about the x axis, ie front-to-back 'pitch'. Side-to-side 'roll' is measured by gamma, which gives rotation about the y axis, as you show in the diagram above.\r\n\r\n- Diagram 'The phone is rotated on the Y-Axis by gamma degrees.' This is confusing because it looks like the y axis isn't aligned with the long axis of the device. Also, it would be good to show the direction of positive gamma, which is positive (using the right-hand-rule) rotation about the y axis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/#toc-deviceorientation\r\n\r\n- 'The device orientation event returns only the rotation data, which includes how much the device is leaning side-to-side (beta), front-to-back (gamma)'. As above, side-to-side is gamma, front-to-back is beta.\r\n\r\n- The four figures are very confusing to me. In the first two cases, if the device is on a 'flat' (I assume you mean horizontal) surface, surely the viewer must be looking down (albeit with north at the top of their field of view), not north? In the second figure, the text should be upside-down (rotated about a vertical axis), not flipped left-right (rotated about a horizontal north-south axis). In the third figure, are you trying to show the device with its screen in a vertical plane, but with the top of the screen leaning towards the viewer's right? If so, this should be {beta: 45, gamma: 90}. In general, I think it would be helpful to use more precise terminology, rather than 'facing' and 'pointing'.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/#toc-devicemotion\r\n\r\n- In the tables, 'Accelerating left' should be 'Accelerating right'. Also, it would be good to use a consistent value for the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity."

128,'ebidel','Update FileReader code to support non-prefixed .slice() method\nThe present example code for slicing file data on the article ["Reading local files in JavaScript"](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/) only supports the vendor-prefixed ```.mozSlice()``` and ```.webkitSlice()``` methods. At least one browser, Opera (as of 11.x), supports the ```.slice()``` method without a vendor prefix, and as such throws an error with the current code, which does not support the unprefixed ```.slice()``` method.\n\nTo fix this, I would recommend the following code example...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    }\n\n...be changed to...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    } else {\n        var blob = file.slice(startingByte, endindByte);\n    }\n\n...and this code example...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    }\n\n...be changed to...\n\n    if (file.webkitSlice) {\n        var blob = file.webkitSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else if (file.mozSlice) {\n        var blob = file.mozSlice(start, stop + 1);\n    } else {\n        var blob = file.slice(start,stop+1);\n    }\n\nThe latter code example also appears in a compressed form as part of the page\'s actual executed code.\n\nThis will check for support for vendor prefixes first, as the article currently does, but will fall back to the non-prefixed ```.slice()``` specification if they\'re not supported.'

Because of this, some of the video + canvas demos\n    \n     at http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/ don't work.\n    \n    To reproduce, using Opera or Opera Next,\n    1) go to http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/\n    2) navigate to demo below the &quot;The only reason we are using two canvases is because the performance is much better than using a single one which imports the images and transforms at the same time.&quot; sentence, the second example in 5.4. VIDEO + CANVAS.\n    3) click play on the video on the left\n    \n    Expected Behavior:\n    The other two videos should start.\n    \n    Actual Behavior:\n    They don't. If you click play a second time, it works.\n    \n    <b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n    \n    This seems like a site bug, rather than an Opera bug. The specification does not say what the default value of the preload attribute should be, but recommends &quot;metadata&quot; ( http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/video.html#attr-media-preload ):\n    The attribute's missing value default is user-agent defined, though the Metadata state is suggested as a compromise between reducing server load and providing an optimal user experience.\n    \n    And as for the event &quot;canplay&quot;:\n    If the previous ready state was HAVE_CURRENT_DATA or less, and the new ready state is HAVE_FUTURE_DATA\n    \n    The user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event named canplay.\n    \n    And state &quot;HAVE_FUTURE_DATA&quot;:\n    HAVE_FUTURE_DATA (numeric value 3)\n    Data for the immediate current playback position is available, as well as enough data for the user agent to advance the current playback position in the direction of playback at least a little without immediately reverting to the HAVE_METADATA state. For example, in video this corresponds to the user agent having data for at least the current frame and the next frame. The user agent cannot be in this state if playback has ended, as the current playback position can never advance in this case.\n    \n    Since the &quot;metadata&quot; preload value will not cause loading enough data to start playback, and it does not even force the browser to load the next frame, we never reach HAVE_FUTURE_DATA state and canplay event is never fired:\n    \n    metadata \tMetadata Hints to the user agent that the author does not expect the user to need the media resource, but that fetching the resource metadata (dimensions, first frame, track list, duration, etc) is reasonable.\n    \n    The fix is pretty easy, though:\n    \n    Just add preload=&quot;auto&quot; to the video element, e.g., <video poster=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/star.png&quot; id=&quot;video-canvas-fancy&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; controls>\n    \n    Alternately, wrap the code of processEffectFrame() with: if (ctx_copy) {...}\n"
