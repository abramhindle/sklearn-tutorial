At various times it has been not validated at all, validated strictly as a url with a protocol and now it's a bit confused.\r\n\r\n![](http://puu.sh/cPdkb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the **server** side, we validate `user.website` using a custom validator extension `isEmptyOrURL` which checks that it is either an empty string or a valid url. The protocol is *not* required. ([See code](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/data/validation/index.js#L26)).\r\n\r\nOn the **client** side, we strictly validate `user.website` using the standard `isURL` but also *requiring* a protocol of either `http://` or `https://`. ([See code](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/client/validators/user.js#L53))\r\n\r\nWhat we should be doing is:\r\n\r\n1. Validating that it is a valid URL *without* requiring a protocol on both the server and client: e.g. `validator.isURL(str, {require_protocol: false})`. \r\n\r\n2. Then on the server side when the data is saved, if the protocol is missing from the URL, we should prefix the URL with `http://`. This ensures that when the URL is output on the frontend, it'll work as an external link as intended.\r\n\r\nBookshelf allows us to modify properties on their way into the database using the [`format`](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/models/user.js#L89) method, similarly to how we can modify properties on their way out using `toJSON`. The server side user model already [has an example of using `toJSON`](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/models/user.js#L89) in order to delete the `password` field. The fix for this issue should follow the same pattern, extending the `format` method in the user model and updating the `website` attribute if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis issue is marked as beginner because it has a very small scope. Although it touches both the client and server side, the changes are only a couple of lines."

4429,'',"Ghost middleware is wrong\n# Ghost middleware is wrong\r\n## The problem\r\nBefore I begin, let me present the middleware displayed in the wiki\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar ghost = require('ghost'),\r\n    express = require('express'),\r\n    parentApp = express();\r\n\r\nghost().then(function (ghostServer) {\r\n    parentApp.use(ghostServer.config.paths.subdir, ghostServer.rootApp);\r\n\r\n    ghostServer.start(parentApp);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIn this snippet, there are two major problems and a minor inconvenience\r\n1. The whole parent application has to wait around for the child to start up\r\n2. The parent gets started **by** the child.\r\n3. (minor) It doesn't really follow the footprint of most other Express middleware\r\n\r\n### 1. Parent has to wait\r\nThis model defeats the whole point of Ghost-as-middleware.\r\nThe primary use case for middleware is to integrate Ghost into a larger body of code (like a corperate website w/ blog). It must therefore be as unobtrusive as possible.\r\nIf the parent's timing is dictated by the startup process of the child, it becomes awkward instead of beautiful. The clean ideas of express middleware are gone.\r\n\r\n### 2. Child starts parent\r\nThis is a breach of seperation concerns. Why is Ghost calling .listen() on the parent app? The parent app is none of Ghost's business.\r\n\r\n## The Ideal\r\nThe way I imagine a proper parent-ghost middleware relationship\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar express = require( 'express' ) \r\nvar ghost = require( 'ghost' )\r\nvar parent = express()\r\n\r\nparent.use( '/store', require( 'some-store-middleware' ) )\r\nparent.use( '/games', require( 'some-games-sub-site' ) )\r\n//... etc etc\r\n\r\n// Ghost sets up to handle requests given to it, and **nothing more**\r\nparent.use( '/blog', ghost(options) )\r\n\r\n// ...more things, set up, complicated calculations of the meaning of life, etc\r\n\r\n//THEN the parent starts up on its own time\r\nparent.listen( parent.get( 'port' ) )\r\n```\r\n# Possible solution\r\nI understand that Ghost is a bit tricky to `require`, since that only provides a promise of future functionality.\r\n\r\nThe way I tackled this back when I was trying to make a push for Ghost middleware is as follows.\r\n*Note: the exact file references might be a bit out of date as there have been over 700 commits since this was written*\r\n\r\n```\r\n// /core/middleware.js\r\nvar ghost = require('./index'),\r\n    errors = require('./server/errors');\r\n\r\nfunction ghostMiddleware(options) {\r\n    var app = false,\r\n        requestBuffer = [];\r\n\r\n    ghost(options).then(function (blog) {\r\n        app = blog.app;\r\n        while (requestBuffer.length) {\r\n            app.apply(app, requestBuffer.pop());\r\n        }\r\n    }).catch(function (err) {\r\n        errors.logErrorAndExit(err, err.context, err.help);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return function (req, res) {\r\n        if (app === false) {\r\n            requestBuffer.unshift([req, res]);\r\n        } else {\r\n            app(req, res);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = ghostMiddleware;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solution provides express with immediately useful, valid middleware.\r\nIn the background, the middleware is caching all incoming requests while it waits for Ghost to be prepared. Once this happens, the middleware routes the backlog of requests in through the application.\r\n\r\nThis is only one potential solution. All I know is that the current implimentation does not sit well with me. Thoughts and critisisms more than welcome."

We also have more general shortcuts like `ctrl/cmd + s` for save.\r\n\r\nSave should work no matter where you're focused in the editor, but the formatting shortcuts should only ever fire when the cursor/focus is in the editor. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, if you use the more common shortcuts like bold, the effect they have is only visible if focus is in the editor. However, if you use the 'ctrl/cmd+shift+c' shortcut which opens a modal with the HTML for the selected text, you'll see that it fires no matter where you are focused but has no content (e.g. put the cursor in the title).\r\n\r\nThis is indicative of the fact that all of the editor formatting shortcuts are firing (but not working) no matter where focus is.

4251,'',"[WIP] Remove authentication for public endpoints\nWIP solution for https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/4181\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome!\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThere is a file core/server/api/publicEndpoints.js that defines all of the publicly available endpoints. These are represented as an array of objects. Each object contains a regex which matches the endpoint, an array allowable verbs (just GET for now - probably forever?), and optionally an array of objects which represent the allowable get queries.\r\n\r\nIn the middleware, before authentication occurs, the request path is passed along to the publicEndpoints module. The module tries to exist ASAP. If it doesn't match a public regex, false is immediately returned. Otherwise a check on the request method (GET) is performed, if it is anything other than the whitelisted verb, the test fails. Finally, get parameters are checked, if any extra or unexpected queries are sent along the entire test fails. If all the tests pass, then the module returns true and the middleware bypasses authentication sending an empty object instead of a user. This breaks a couple of the operations because a user model is expected. A potential solution is to have a built in Public API user which is used only for public facing API calls.\r\n\r\nThis seemed like a good approach as it makes it simple to add public calls (just add an object with the appropriate regex for the route, allowed verbs and allowed queries) and removing a public route just means removing the corresponding object.\r\n\r\nRight now, the regexes are hard coded which isn't that big of a deal with the exception of the API version. This should be dynamically built based on a configuration so that when the API version updates, this code doesn't need to be changed."

This brings up the "Are you sure?" modal, where you can hit "Delete" to kill your post for good. Because I used a keyboard shortcut to enter the modal, I expect them to keep working, and hit "enter".

But I got home, installed the project locally (surprisingly easily!), and started coding.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of abstracting media queries is that by having a centralised, single source of truth where all major breakpoints are defined, you can iterate on the product with more confidence and velocity.\r\n\r\nsass-mq (http://git.io/sass-mq) can help with that ([in version 1.4.0](https://github.com/guardian/sass-mq/tree/v1.4.0), to be compatible with Libsass). Feel free to browse the README of sass-mq if you want to know the specifics.\r\n\r\nI found a number of different breakpoints/tweakpoints. Is there a reason why there are so many? See this list:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<= & > 350px\r\n<= & > 400px\r\n<= & > 500px\r\n<=     550px\r\n<= & > 600px\r\n<= & > 630px\r\n<= & > 650px\r\n>=     768px\r\n<= & > 900px\r\n<= & > 1000px\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes having a @media query abstraction prevents proliferation and helps keeping the codebase maintainable. Maybe it would help reducing the number of breakpoints?\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and if I can help further. Ideally you could take that branch as is and just iterate on it if you like the principles behind sass-mq.'

It may be that we count from 0.5.0 until 0.6.0, or that there are significant enough releases in the middle to reset. We should probably do something consistent, so for now I think we should assume it's going to be the last minor version bump (so 0.5.0, then 0.6.0...).\r\n\r\nRunning `git shortlog -s -n --no-merges 0.5.0..master` gives me something [like this list](https://gist.github.com/ErisDS/a849772266fd028e5c40) and is the command I usually run to generate the list for the release post.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of top contribs for the about page uses the specified tag to fetch a date, and then uses the date to fetch the top contributors according to the github stats page here on the repo.\r\n\r\nAs it is possible for commits to have been done before the tag was cut, this means we get a slightly different result, which is confusing.\r\n\r\nI recommend instead using the following API endpoint to get all the commits between two points, and manually looping over the commits and counting how many their are per author.

If the user goes over the max, it\'s displayed in the SERP as if it will be accepted, however, it will fail client-side validation because the validations are currently set to a hard limit of 70 (meta-title) and 156 (meta-description) characters.  Additionally, the error message doesn\'t indicate what the limit is, so the user is left to guess.\r\n\r\nThe maximum lengths for those fields in the database are 150 and 200 characters respectively.  I think it makes sense to either get rid of the client-side validations for these fields and let the server validate them (which is how the post title currently works), or to adjust the client-side validation limits to match the database schema and provide an appropriate error message.\r\n'

4121,'jaswilli',"Post Settings Menu: Make the default publish date and slug values editable\nIssue history:\r\n\r\nThis issue is being raised in favour of #3204 and #3382 - two separate issues which each covered the same usability problem, one for the slug and one for the published date.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the original issue which described the desired behaviour of these 2 fields is here: #1351. \r\n\r\nWe have also had PRs for these two issues: #3875 for #3204 (date) and #3390 for #3382 (slug), however both of the PRs are currently stalled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe underlying usability problem with the two of these fields, is that the placeholder value, which is the default value, is something that a user might reasonably want to edit. However as they are implemented as placeholders, the data disappears as soon as you focus the field.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to change the behaviour of the two fields, so that the default value can be edited. However this isn't quite straightforward as the two fields behave slightly differently:\r\n\r\n- On a new post, the slug placeholder updates it's value as the title updates, until the post is saved for the first time. According to #1351, this is meant to stay a placeholder until the post is published, but I believe this was deliberately changed (although I'm not 100%).\r\n- On a new post, the date is set to the current time by default. It doesn't get converted to a value on save, so each time the post is reopened, the updated current time will be shown until either a custom date is entered, or the post is published.\r\n\r\nSo in short:\r\n- slug -> default converted to saved value on first save\r\n- date -> default converted to saved value on publish\r\n\r\nIn order to make these defaults editable, we need to set them as values, rather than as the placeholder. \r\nHowever, if the values aren't edited by the user, the defaults should continue to update until the point at which they become a proper saved value in the same way as they do now."

This should make it 100% clear what that variable is, as using upper case for classes and lower for instances is a common convention.\r\n\r\nNext, we need a convention for various express instances. Express is always included as \r\n`express = require('express')` and then needs instances creating. Therefore we can't use `express` as a name for an instance, plus it's kind of log and a weird name anyway.. what is an `express` when it's at home?\r\n\r\nIn the express docs, the common name for an instance is `app`. Nice and short and sort of indicates what it is, sort of... however we have many of them, so I recommend always using a prefix.\r\n\r\nTo that end, let's have a rule: general terms like `app`, `server`, `instance`, `object` should not be used as variable names without a clarifying prefix. Sooo `adminApp` and `blogApp` are fine, `ghostServer` is fine etc??\r\n\r\nAlso whilst we're here, lets also clarify that the naming convention for files should be all lower cased and dashed. So `ghost-server.js` not `GhostServer.js` and `object-type-model-map.js` and `local-file-store.js` and so on and so forth for all the oddities.\r\n\r\n### TL;DR\r\n\r\n* `app`, `server`, and `instance` cannot be used as a var name without a clarifying prefix like `ghostServer`\r\n* instances of classes should start with lowercase, so `ghostServer` is an instance of `GhostServer`\r\n* All filenames should be lower cased and dashed so `ghost-server.js`\r\n"

This is the same idea that we have in the settings screens, where the menu is `/ghost/settings/` and when you drop down to viewing, for example the general settings screen, the URL changes to `/ghost/settings/general/`. \r\n\r\n![](http://puu.sh/byssS.png) \r\n\r\n## Preview View\r\n\r\nThe preview view is where the most work is required. The navigation concept for mobile sub views that we have both here and in the settings screens, is the `.global-nav` element disappears and gets replaced instead with a `.page-header` element. These elements aren\'t dynamically generated, they\'re always both in the source code for each subview, but one is shown and the other is hidden.\r\n\r\n![](http://puu.sh/bystW.png)\r\n\r\nOn the preview view, the `.page-header` element needs to be updated to be similar to the page-header for the general settings screen. The title should read "Preview", the burger menu icon should be replaced with the back button (the one that currently appears below which shouldn\'t be there) and the edit button should appear in the top right on top of the header (I believe this can be done with `position: fixed`). \r\n\r\n## TLDR;\r\n\r\nThe following things need changing:\r\n\r\n- [ ] On desktop, there should be no back button on the content screen\r\n- [ ] On mobile, the back button on the preview screen should appear in the top left as part of the header bar\r\n- [x] On mobile, the URL for the content screen should be `/ghost/`, the preview screen should be `/ghost/:id/` (#4032)\r\n- [ ] On mobile, the edit button should appear over the header bar in the top right\r\n- [ ] The title on the preview screen should be \'Preview\'\r\n'

Ghost doesn't seem to recognize middle-click paste, and behaves completely differently depending on the browser. In Firefox 32.0, it doesn't do anything unless a URL had been highlighted, then it actually goes to that url. In Chrome 39.0.2145.4 dev (64-bit), it sometimes works, but almost always inserts a '$' instead.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run Ghost on a Linux machine\r\n2.

3982,'',"Bug: Admin session is not restricted to /ghost/\n### Issue Summary\r\n\r\nBefore we switched to ember-simple-auth/OAuth the admin session was restricted to the `/ghost/` subdirectory by setting the path in the cookie. ember-simple-auth uses localstorage to save the access_token and refresh_token. This causes some problems when having multiple Ghost instances installed on the same domain but in different subdirectories. The authentication from Ghost instance A will cause a conflict with the one from Ghost instance B (either by not being valid when logged in or by signing you out when logging in to a different instance). \r\n\r\nSee: https://ghost.org/forum/installation/16209-multi-blog-site-with-auth-conflicts/\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

3979,'','[Discussion] Theme package.json: Declare compatible Ghost version\nI am on a quest to reduce the confusion around Ghost themes and whether they are compatible with a specific version of Ghost, as well as improve the rate at which themes get updated when we add or remove features. 9 months after we originally introduced the required `{{asset}}` helper, and 6 months after `{{pageUrl}}` was deprecated and `package.json` added, I still see many themes which haven\'t updated for one of these changes.\r\n\r\nOne part of this is very definitely our lack of communication. Although I always blog about changes, there has never been a good resource. Today I\'ve done a first pass of a [theme API change log](http://docs.ghost.org/themes/changelog/) which I hope to see expand into a resource which details every change, the impact, how to upgrade your theme etc.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is time to start requiring that a theme declare which version of Ghost it is compatible with in the package.json file.\r\n\r\nI am not 100% certain whether this is a correct use-case for `peerDependences`, or  whether we should do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  "name": "Casper",\r\n  "version": "1.0.1"\r\n  "ghost": {\r\n     "version": "0.5.0"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe already use the Ghost key for `ghost.permissions` for apps, so it may make sense to keep all of our custom Ghost related keys under a single `ghost` key? \r\n\r\nWhichever we choose, the result should be a Ghost startup warning around themes that are incompatible. A theme should be deemed *incompatible* if:\r\n\r\n- it does not have a package.json\r\n- it has a package.json but no Ghost version specified\r\n- it has a specified Ghost version which is lower than the current Ghost version (according to semver)\r\n\r\nNote: At the same time as we introduce this, I also want to introduce the requirement that a theme\'s `package.json` specifies the `author` key (name, version and author are required to be a valid package.json file according to npm). There should be warnings output by Ghost if `name`, `version`, `author` or whatever we pick for declaring the Ghost version is missing.\r\n\r\nOnce we\'ve shipped this change, and done a bit of extra communication to theme developers around these changes, there are two further steps I think we ought to take (in subsequent releases, so that the move towards requiring this is gradual but very clear).\r\n\r\nFirst, we\'ll add a top notification to any blog whose active theme is *incompatible*. This won\'t affect anything, but will encourage blog owners to nag their respective theme developers. \r\n\r\nSecond, we\'ll make it so that it is not possible to activate an *incompatible* theme. Ghost will still start if the theme is already activated, but any attempt to choose a theme which is incompatible from the dropdown should fail with a sensible notification.\r\n\r\nSummary of tasks:\r\n\r\n- [ ] decide on a format for the Ghost version, peerDep or ghost.version\r\n- [ ] make Ghost output startup warnings if it is missing\r\n- [ ] make Ghost output startup warnings if `author` is missing\r\n- [ ] **bonus** create a way to determine if the currently active theme is *incompatible* perhaps via a theme API endpoint'

It is also (I believe) a change from how the old editor works.\r\n\r\nWhen Ghost receives markdown to save on the server, it processes it into HTML using slightly different rules to the editor (no image upload dropzone). The server does not save the HTML it is sent, so sending it is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nSending the full model/object from Ember is correctly the default behaviour, but in this case it means we're sending a huge payload of data that just gets chucked away on the other side.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I've seen with Ghost 0.5, the first ever complaint that a post could not be saved due to a `Request entity too large` error. For a really (really) long (and complex) post, the amount of data in the `html` field will be even more than the `markdown` field - the request will more than double in size (all the other fields are really small) significantly increasing the likelihood we'll run into this (although it's still quite unlikely).\r\n\r\nIt is my recommendation that the Ember client should send an empty `html` field to the server."

See how old Ghost (Casper theme) renders some text with single and double quotes in the title and body text:\r\n\r\n![straight](http://puu.sh/7q167.png)\r\n\r\nThe latest version of Ghost has rudimentary curly quote support. It doesn\'t always get it right, but it looks better than it did:\r\n\r\n![curly](http://puu.sh/7q149.png)\r\n\r\nYay! Curly Quotes! The titles are Open Sans which have sort-of fancy quotes, and the body text is Noto Serif which has nice curly quotes. So blogs are looking better, but the editor is still not quite right:\r\n\r\n## Master\r\n\r\nHere\'s how the Ghost Editor looks today, on master (the same version that rendered curly quotes on the frontend in Casper):\r\n\r\n![master](http://puu.sh/7q0g6.png)\r\n\r\n### What\'s going on:\r\n\r\nIn the left pane, the font is the stock \'monospace\' font. It should be Inconsolata, and the plan was always to add Inconsolata to the admin via Google fonts.\r\n\r\nIn the right pane, the font is the sans serif font Open Sans for both titles and body text.\r\n\r\nNeither of these two fonts render curly quotes in a typographically awesome and curly way. In the current implementation of the editor, the left pain retains straight quotes, but the right pane has curly quotes, but this doesn\'t quite match up with what you see on the frontend.\r\n\r\nObviously all themes will have different fonts, some with awesome curly quotes and some without, but shouldn\'t the editor\'s default closely match Casper i.e. have Noto Serif body text?\r\n\r\n## With Inconsolata\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, the left pane in the editor is *supposed* to be Inconsolata. If I add it as was intended, here\'s what you get:\r\n\r\n![inconsolata](http://puu.sh/7q109.png)\r\n\r\n### What\'s going on:\r\n\r\nIn the left pane, the font is now the intended Inconsolata font, the right pane is still all Open Sans. However, inconsolata\'s straight quotes look like two right curly quotes, so it looks broken, even though it isn\'t.\r\n\r\nTherefore I recommend that the left pane be changed to a monospace font that looks better? There is one called [Cousine](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine) which supports an extensive number of character sets (which people may wish to add via an app/language pack thing).\r\n\n'

This allows content to be easily discoverable in search engines as well as popular social networks where blog posts are typically shared.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of contexts for this, the most important of which are listed below - along with a proposed implementation structure.\r\n\r\nOne additional consideration is that it should be possible for apps to modify and extend this output. Eg. a Disqus app might want to add a `commentCount` property, and social apps might want to add `interactionCount` values.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this issue, Privacy.md should be updated with details of what data is being output and why. There should also be a flag available for config.js which disables automatic structured data from being output at all.\r\n\r\nComments, additions or suggestions on the proposed structure below are welcome.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update Privacy.md (@JohnONolan)\r\n- [x] Add flag to disable output in config.js\r\n- [ ] Implement Schema.org output\r\n- [x] Implement Open Graph output\r\n- [ ] Implement Twitter Cards output\r\n- [x] Implement hooks to allow apps to modify output\r\n\r\n## Schema.org\r\n\r\nWith the [news](http://searchengineland.com/goodbye-google-authorship-201975) that Google is ending support for Authorship came the followup of a [renewed focus](https://plus.google.com/+JohnMueller/posts/HZf3KDP1Dm8) on Schema.org microformats. Until now we\'ve been shy to adopt this despite multiple PR\'s to add it to Casper, mainly because it makes a horrendous mess of the markup and no clear indication that it was a focus of major search engines.\r\n\r\nNow there\'s a clear focus from a major search engine, and I\'ve also recently discovered the [JSON Linked Data](http://www.seoskeptic.com/json-ld-google-knowledge-graph-schema-org-seo/) ([JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD)) format which means that not only can we have uncluttered markup - but we can also keep the structured data abstracted from the theme.

3899,'',"Publish posts internally\nThere has already been discussion about privately publishing posts (#2315, #2248, #1756) and authored permalinks (#3858). A logical step would be to allow authors to publish internally, so that only other members can see posts listed, and Ghost is in an excellent position to do this with the addition of multi-user blogs.\r\n\r\nI'm sure further discussion would have to take place about the implementation, but my initial proposal is to reserve two tags: `shared` and `internal`. The `shared` tag would prevent posts from being listed, but authors and other members would be able to share posts via permalink. The `internal` tag would prevent posts from being listed but would also cause posts shared via permalink to return a 404.\r\n\r\nThis could be extended to allow users to define which roles are specified by the `internal` tag, or even publishing to arbitrary roles at the author's discretion.\r\n\r\nI'm not vying particularly hard for publishing only to certain roles, but I'm very much in love with the idea of internal posts so that I can blog privately within my organization."

3886,'ErisDS',"Move Ghost-UI back into the Ghost repository\nBack in [March](http://dev.ghost.org/no-more-ruby-dependency/) we moved all of Ghost's SASS over to the [Ghost-UI](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI) repository so that we no longer had a ruby dependency here in the main Ghost repo.\r\n\r\nWe also hoped to turn the SASS into a Bootstrap-esque framework for creating interfaces that look like Ghost. We hoped to share the code between Ghost and Ghost.org, as well as provide an easy way for people building internal and external apps for Ghost to maintain consistency.\r\n\r\nThis was an experiment, and the experiment has failed for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, maintaining code across 2 repositories is a nightmare. Issues get raised in one, the other, or both, and it's always confusing, pull requests which change html & css have to be done in 2 places, and links between issues in the 2 repos aren't clear.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the move to Ember makes it *almost* impossible to build flexible, generic and reusable components outside of the Ghost repository. This removes half the point of having a separate framework for the UI. It makes it less likely the code will be shared, and it means creating components is just a lot more work.\r\n\r\nWhilst the SASS has been in the [Ghost-UI](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI) repo, it has been reviewed, refactored and a big redesign done. The result is that we no longer really need to use ruby SASS, as we are no longer depending on the extended features of it and of bourbon.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the plan is to switch to libsass, move the SASS code back to the Ghost repository, and go back to the way things were but still without the awful ruby dependency.\r\n\r\n- [x] convert the SASS to libsass (@pauladamdavis)\r\n- [x] move the code back to the Ghost repo (@ErisDS)\r\n- [x] wire up grunt to build the SASS (@ErisDS)\r\n- [x] move the ghost-ui issues back to the Ghost repo"

3884,'','Reimplement the {{content words="0"}} functionality\nThere is a reasonably well known bug in the theme API, whereby if you have an `<img>` tag as the first thing in your post, `{{content words="0"}}` will output it. (Also works for `<audio>` and `<video>` and possibly other embedded content tags I believe).\r\n\r\nThis is due to a bug in [downsize](https://github.com/cgiffard/Downsize) that has long since been fixed. Downsize has also received some new features, and we would like to upgrade to benefit from these. Furthermore, the proper feature/cover image for posts functionality is to be implemented soon, so in order to deprecate the hack in favour of the true feature, we need control over the code and how it works. Therefore, we want to move this *feature* into Ghost.\r\n\r\nTo do this, the `{{content}}` helper should be changed such that if the `words` option gets passed "0" as a value, we run our own HTML parser which grabs the first tag from the post, and outputs it if it is is an image tag. This feature should result in identical results to the existing implementation via downsize. Further tests for various tags is will be needed and the PR should provide the before-and-after output.\r\n'

This possibly needs looking at in bookshelf / knex, but we should catch these errors and provide a more sane one.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, providing the wrong name for `pg` results in weird errors, one reported via twitter:\r\n\r\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bu2Ke8tCQAAcqBP.png)\r\n\r\nAnd another on GitHub: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/3509#issuecomment-50886603\r\n\r\nWe should validate that the client is one of `sqlite3`, `mysql` or `pg` and provide a sensible error if it isn't. Perhaps even a warning if it's pg saying support is unofficial?\r\n\r\n## 2. Invalid content path / other config\r\n\r\nOriginally from #3849:\r\n> If paths.contentPath is incorrect, a cryptic `Casper not installed` error is thrown:\r\n\r\nIf `paths.contentPath` is set, we ought to test that that path exists, and that it contains the 4 folders that we expect. If it doesn't, again we should give a clear error message.\r\n\r\n## 3. `npm install` failures\r\n\r\nOriginall from #3509:\r\n\r\n> On a fresh copy of Ghost if you run npm start --production before running npm install --production there is no useful messaging indicating why things have failed\r\n\r\nAny missing module produces the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.js:340\r\n    throw err;\r\n          ^\r\nError: Cannot find module 'when'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is obvious to Ghost devs because we know what `when` or any other module is. To anyone new, this is baffling. It needs catching and replacing with a clear message stating that npm install has failed.\r\n\r\n## 4. Bad node version\r\n\r\nHaving the wrong node version has always failed during `npm install` with unclear messaging. I believe that the main module we have which causes this, `sqlite3` now handles this better, but sqlite3 supports node >0.11.13 which Ghost does not yet. We have an error message which should appear if you get as far as starting Ghost, this needs testing.\r\n\r\n## 5. SQLITE_READONLY and other permissions errors\r\n\r\nfrom #3687\r\n\r\nWhen Ghost starts, we should detect if we have permissions to write to `/content/data` and `/content/images`. if the database client is `sqlite3` we should also specifically check if we have permissions to write to the db file. If the permissions are wrong, we should output a sensible error.\r\n"

3789,'',"Pull the app.listen code out of the ghost internals\nI'm looking at what it would take to convert ghost into something that can be used as express middleware.\r\n\r\nOne issue that needs to be tackled is that Ghost calls `app.listen` internally.\r\n\r\nThis code could probably be pulled out of core. Instead, the main ghost `index.js` file could carry the responsibility of starting the app.\r\nYou'd end up with an `index.js` file that could look something like this.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar ghost = require('./core'),\r\n    errors = require('./core/server/errors');\r\n\r\nghost().then(function(app){\r\n    app.start();\r\n}).otherwise(function (err) {\r\n    errors.logErrorAndExit(err, err.context, err.help);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, any site wanting to include a ghost blog as middleware could include `ghost/core` and they don't have to worry about ports being bound.\r\n\r\nWould such a change be viewed favorably?

The cookie still exists on the server, but is removed from the browser and you can't access server resources anymore.

This means that anyone trying to do a multi-user import is going to end up with posts that don't have an author, which shouldn't be possible.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty bad bug, it's going to cause people to end up with blogs in horrible states. \r\n\r\nThe fix is going to be a bit of a big thing to have to crowbar in at this late stage, but without it, migrating to MU is going to be nigh-impossible, significantly reducing the point of releasing it :(("

To use this feature with Ghost would require that config.js be checked into the Github source repository.  Checking in security credentials like the username/password of your email provider is bad security practice.\r\n\r\nI'm motivated to get Ghost to the point where you can just fork your repository, drop in some templates (if needed), and publish a website on Azure.  This is a clean approach that will let Ghost users keep up to date with new releases easily and encourages them to 'Use The Source, Luke'.  Azure has an 'easy Ghost deploy' wizard, but it's already out of date and that makes me :-(\r\n\r\nI would like to change Ghost's behavior so it doesn't require config.js to be modified for a simple installation.  First step in this path is to get email working without having to drop the configuration and credentials into a source file.  I would like to modify Ghost so it searches process.environment for these settings.\r\n\r\nMy proposed spec is that if the environment variables EMAIL_SERVICE, EMAIL_USERNAME, and EMAIL_PASSWORD are set that config.development.mail and config.production.mail data structures would be populated using these values.

If you then go and revoke their invitation, that post gets completely deleted. So, either they need to accept the invite before they are allowed to have posts moved under them, or all posts are getting deleted when a user is removed. (I have not tested with this with an accepted user yet)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Invite a new author user\r\n2. Change a post to be under their name\r\n3. Revoke the invitation\r\n4.

3426,'sebgie',"Move Transfer Ownership to own API endpoint\nAs I've been working on writing tests for #3196 and also getting the user permissions correct and tested for #3096 I've hit a roadblock whereby it's impossible to make all of the conditions pass.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I have what I believe is a full suite of tests, where one test always fails. Every time I fix the permissions so that the broken test passes, that change breaks another test.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of underlying problems with the permissions model which is causing this:\r\n\r\nFor user edit and add we now have 2 permissions checks:\r\n\r\n`canThis(context).add/edit.user(userId)` and `canThis(context).assign.role(roleId)`\r\n\r\nThis is a bit restrictive in that:\r\n\r\n1. We can't ask if the context can assign a role to a specific user, essentially the code should probably be:\r\n\r\n`canThis(context).add.roleUser(roleId, userId)`\r\n\r\nBut joinTables aren't treated as models and canThis isn't really setup for testing the join tables. `canThis(context).add.role(roleId, userId)` or `canThis(context).add.role(roleId).to.user(userId)` would be great, but will require extensive reworking of canThis. \r\n\r\nThe side effect of this is that the check which prevents modifying your own role has to be outside of the permissions system: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/3395/files#diff-e1c52a506c4dfb4202439ef6db5f2de0R111\r\n\r\nThis is not so bad, and we'll likely have an issue to extend `canThis` and fix this later.\r\n\r\n2. Inside of testing for `assign` permissions, we don't know whether we're assigning to a new or existing user.\r\n\r\nThe rules for assigning to an existing user, and assigning to a brand new user are subtly different:\r\n\r\n- no one can assign the owner role to a new user\r\n- owners can assign the owner role to an existing admin user\r\n\r\nThis could be solved by having 2 permissions: assignToNew and assignToExisting, but the above latter rule is actually just one very special case purely for transferring ownership. When the owner wants to transfer their ownership to another user, they can do so only if the other user exists and is already an admin. No one else is ever allowed to perform this action, and this action is already considered to be different to a standard edit in the UI (there's a different control),\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems odd to me that in a certain case, calling edit on a user model can cause more than one user to be updated. \r\n\r\nFinally this would resolve both my problems with the permissions model and #3403 in one fell swoop. Therefore I believe, making an endpoint just for this change makes the most sense.\r\n\r\nThat just leaves what to call it.. I'm looking at:\r\n\r\n` router.put('/users/owner', api.http(api.users.transferOwnership));`"

The first is `Ember.computed(dependencies, theFunction)` and the second is the `property` method that Ember metal puts on function prototypes `theFunction(){}.property(dependencies)`\r\n\r\n\r\nUp until now, our style has been to use the `property` method for custom functions, but we still see `Ember.computed` for its submethods like `alias`, `readOnly`, `oneWay`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Argument for switch to `Ember.computed`\r\n\r\n@rwjblue and @jaswilli have both advocated for using `Ember.computed` over `.property` because it places the fact that *this is a property* at the very beginning of the property definition, rather than obscuring it by placing it at the end of the function. Similarly, it puts the dependencies of the property up front.\r\n\r\nI've been whining about PRs that use `Ember.computed` over property simply because we have until now been using `property` and I like consistency, but maybe it's time to do a revamp and switch everything over to `Ember.computed` and drop all `.property` uses?"

If empty strings need to be checked at this level `validations: { 'empty': false }` could be used in the `schema.js` declarations.\r\n\r\nThe failure can be reproduced by trying to import a JSON file that has a featured post (featured: 1) or a post set to be a page (page: 1)."

Which kind of sucks.\r\n\r\nLast year, a small movement started in the Open Source community which is slowly evolving into a standard practice: The inclusion of a SECURITY.md file in every repository - outlining the security policy for the project.\r\n\r\nSo, my idea is this: \r\n\r\n**PRIVACY.md - A plain English summary of all components within a repository which may affect user privacy. A single, standardised location to find out what's going on under the hood.** \r\n\r\nThis PR is speculative and open to discussion - Have a look at the attached changeset for an example of what this might look like in the context of Ghost.\r\n\r\nWhile we already have a flag to disable Ghost update-checks, I would suggest that a nice followup to this would be if there was a config flag for *every item* in PRIVACY.md to allow it to be disabled, if so desired. Along with a blanket rule flag, to disable absolutely everything. (Perhaps `tinfoil: true`)"

2982,'ErisDS',"[Feature] Multi-User\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdding multi-user support for ghost so that teams of people can write a blog together. This involves administrators, editors and authors. Shazam.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Details:\r\n\r\n### The new owner role\r\n\r\nThe `owner` is a user which is one level above admin. An owner can do absolutely anything - no permissions apply to them, or rather `canThis` should default to `true` if the user has role `owner`.\r\n\r\nThere can only ever be one `owner` in a Ghost blog, and a user with role `owner` cannot be deleted. \r\n\r\nAn `owner` can choose to transfer `ownership` (that is the `owner` role) to any other admin user.\r\n\r\nThe `owner` role will be setup with a single user as a fixture. That user will be 'commandeered' or taken-over by the first signup (setup). In existing Ghost blogs, the single current admin user will be upgraded to an owner.\r\n\r\n### The new setup flow\r\n\r\nGhost blogs will be 'installed' or 'setup' from the new setup screen, the signup screen will no longer be used for creating the first user, but only for creating new users.\r\n\r\nThe setup screen includes the blog title as well as the user details.\r\n\r\nThe setup screen will hijack the new 'owner' role user which will be a fixture.\r\n\r\n### The invite flow\r\n\r\nUsers will be added to a Ghost blog by being invited. The invite screen is shown here: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI/issues/21.\r\n\r\nThe new owner role can do anything it likes.\r\nAn admin can invite a user, and that user can have the admin, editor or author role.\r\nAn editor can invite a user, but that user can only have the author role.\r\nAn author cannot invite a user.\r\n\r\nAn invite creates a user with an empty name and password, but with an email address. The invited user has a status of 'invited'.\r\n\r\nOnce invited, a user is sent an email with a URL with a token, similar to a forgotten password URL. The URL takes them to the signup screen and allows them to enter their name and password, and pre-fills their email address (it can be changed).\r\n\r\nThe signup process then completes the details of the user, and changes the status to 'active'. The user is automatically logged in.\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\n## The Plan!\r\n\r\nI don't normally write up a plan of what issues need to be done first, but in order to deliver MU very very fast, I thought it would help.\r\n\r\nGetting Ghost MU-ready involves three main tasks: 1. making it possible to create and manage multiple users 2. making the admin safe for multiple users and 3. adding features to make Ghost work nicely with multiple users. The 3 individual tasks should be able to run concurrently, although it will be tricky to test the safety and features without having at least 2 users in the system, and that will be easier once the creation and management tools are in place, so that has to take slight priority.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I've grouped the issues above into 2 phases that can happen concurrently.

When run under the casper tests the `bind` method is undefined on [this line](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/client/components/gh-codemirror.js#L40) and [this line](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/client/components/gh-codemirror.js#L8) causing an error which means the editor doesn't initialise.\r\n\r\nIf I comment out those lines it sort of works but obviously the functionality they pertain to breaks. I'm not sure what's happening to cause bind to be undefined, I've tried adding a massive delay (weird casper test issues are usually timing errors), but that didn't help. I'm wondering if the libraries are loading in the wrong order or something. Have just done a google search (I was working without the internet) and found [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22666866/casperjs-not-working-with-javascript-app-page) which I'll investigate further tomorrow.\r\n\r\n**Update:** Just to clarify what happened in this PR as there are a number of comments - bind, and a number of other modern javascript functions are not supported by Phantom.js because [reasons](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/phantomjs/r0hPOmnCUpc/uxusqsl2LNoJ). Casper.js therefore also doesn't support those methods. Casper.js ships with a bind polyfil, but it only works inside of [casper itself](Bind polyfill doesn't work when testing Ember.js apps #953). I attempted to use `clientScripts` to inject the polyfil into the admin, but it happens too late, and the error has already happened before it is finished.\r\n\r\nTherefore we're left with 2 choices, 1 replace bind in the real code (which I did with lodash) or inject some polyfil manually into the code when running in the test environment. The latter is possibly a better long term solution, but I opted for lodash because it took 30seconds and time is of the essence, but raised #3010 to track this possible improvement."

They do not fade out.\r\n* Ghost UI needs updating to work with these cats (@pauladamdavis). Right now, they have the class `ghost-popover`, and their display is toggled via an ember-applied `open` class. For now, `ember-hacks.css` is making it work  `ghost-ui.css` by arguing over a few particular selectors.\r\n* Speaking of Ghost UI, by default the `gh-popover-button` uses the `<button>` tag, but a few of these buttons had to be `<a>` tags due to Ghost UI\'s css.

The issue is data corruption being caused by node-postgres converting javascript arrays into postgres arrays (pg uses ```{}``` to bound arrays).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Ghost has a setting ```installedApps``` with a default value of ```'[]'``` (a string representation of an empty array) which is being converted to ```{}``` and saved.  Before #2700 values sent into ```api.settings.edit``` were run through ```JSON.stringify``` prior to being saved into the database (https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/2795e723e151b018e3b1d6bdc31aebb96994c8a2#diff-12a8dbd78d369667d9a6160c856477dfL219).

Right now we are using $.ajax, but it feels like we're having to do a lot of work ourselves that would be done for us by other solutions.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we're looking at [Ember Model](https://github.com/ebryn/ember-model), [Ember Data](http://emberjs.com/api/data/) and [Orbit.js](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit.js/tree/master) as potential solutions - or should we just stick with $.ajax for now?\r\n\r\n**Note:** The outcome from this discussion should be a clear plan on how we are going to deal with models/data documented on https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Ember-Admin-UI"
2698,'','Admin Area Access Facing Externally\nI am just starting out with Ghost to create a blog relating to Internet Security. The issue I would like to raise is the fact that the admin log in is an externally facing page. I realize that this is part of what makes Ghost so portable, being able to sign in and blog on the go, but for those of us who wish to lock down their blog a little better I would like to propose that it be possible for blog owners to set up some sort of IP whitelisting for administrative access. I am currently using the hosting services of Ghost (on a 30 day trial) and I see nowhere where I can apply this sort of filtering. This is probably left to a user to create if they host it on their own domain currently, but I would feel a little safer blogging with the hosting services of Ghost if this were possible. That way I could whitelist  my home IP and only be able to access the administrative panel from there. Please inform me if this is already planned (though I did check the roadmap) or if this is already being implemented and I simply have not found it. Thank you.'

One example is https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/api/users.js#L54. In addition to having to access the first element we always need to check whether the correct elements were provided to the API (https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/api/users.js#L10-L15) - this can be unified to work for all entities.\r\n\r\nWe had a quick discussion about this in IRC: http://107.20.237.151:8081/logs/%23ghost/20140506#pm32954\r\n\r\nThis can happen as part of the Ember work as it will not touch API responses, just clean up certain parts of the internal API handling.\r\n\r\nAlso: Dibs.'

In some cases I had to remove calls to the Base parent methods and copy such functionality in order to keep Base clean.\r\n\r\nI added a class method `base#permittedAttributes` that pulls the schema attributes from a method of the same name on its prototype, in order to filter them where I saw it was needed.

2643,'sebgie','Error message responses\nDuring yesterday\'s [public meeting](http://dev.ghost.org/public-dev-meeting-22nd-apr/) we discussed the need for a unified error response format.\r\n\r\nI think we have determined that our key requirements are: \r\n\r\n* to be able to return multiple errors \r\n* to be able to link an error to a particular property on an object (i.e. validation errors)\r\n* to be able to return a sane and consistent response from both the internal and HTTP calls, preferably without duplicating status codes in the response object\r\n\r\nThe solution suggested was something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    errors: [\r\n    {\r\n        "message":"Maximum length of 150 exceeded.",\r\n        "property":"title", \r\n        "type":"ValidationError"\r\n    },\r\n    {...}\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere message is the description of the problem (may or may not be shown to the user), property indicate which property on the object the error relates to if there is one, and type is a human-readable name for the error which would map to an HTTP status code.\r\n\r\nSome questions / concerns I have:\r\n\r\n**Message:**\r\nSome formats such as the [http_problem](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2013/05/15/http_problem) or [collection+JSON])http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/#objects-error) format define both a title and a message/detail field. When logging errors to the console in Ghost we try to provide an error message, a context message and a help message. This makes sense on the console where there is no other visual context to a message, and doesn\'t really make sense in the UI where a simple message with visual context is probably more helpful. However it does beg the question, what should the error message \'be\', does it need one or two parts and should we expect it to be shown directly to the user?\r\n\r\nI think that in general we should consider that these messages are being passed between different parts of an application, regardless of whether they are sent via HTTP (to the Ember client) or internally (to some server side code or to an App) and that the application will try to do something useful with the message, such as display it in context to the user, change it for a user-friendly version, translate it, or if it doesn\'t know what to do, display it directly. I think that one message should be enough, no need for a title?\r\n\r\n**Property:**\r\nThis relates directly to the object / endpoint in question, so if the error is in a response from the post API, the property is *probably* a property of the post model.\r\n\r\nGiven the example of `title` should we return simply `title` or `posts.title` or even `posts[0].title` ?? The need to consider this becomes clearer if you think about returning a validation error for author name? Should it be `name`, `author.name`, `posts.author.name`?\r\n\r\n**Type:** \r\nI really like the idea of using a type -> status code map. There can be multiple error types which map to a single code, and it would even be possible to introduce subclassing so we could have a generic `ServerError` (500) and apps could return a `MyAppServerError` or `MyApp-ServerError` or `ServerError.MyApp` or something similar - any completely unknown type should map to 500 I think?\r\n\r\nAlso up for debate is whether it should be a simple human-readable string like ValidationError, ServerError, etc, or whether it should be returned in the form of a URI like docs.ghost.org/api/errors#ServerError or https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/API/Errors#ServerError?\r\n\r\nI think having a URL would be nice, but a lot of extra work to maintain, perhaps we could add this later as a separate field?\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of what it might end up looking like\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    settings: [{...}],\r\n    errors: [{\r\n        "message":"Maximum length of 150 exceeded for key \'title\'.",\r\n        "property":"settings[5].value", \r\n        "type":"ValidationError"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        "message":"Invalid email for key \'email\'",\r\n        "property":"settings[10].value", \r\n        "type":"ValidationError"\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    db: [{...}],\r\n    errors: [{\r\n        "message": "Unsupported Media Type: *.bmp",\r\n        "type":"UnsupportedMediaError"\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n        '

2622,'',"Proposal: Use JSDoc Code Documentation\nI would really love for Ghost to switch to JSDoc and start documenting all functions and variables used throughout the project.  Right now Ghost only has a scattering of code documented, making for a code base that relies on the reader to interpret all code without any help from comments and docs from the developers that implemented the code that currently exists.\r\n\r\nIn using JSDoc's it should really help make clear what arguments a function expects to receive, making for easier reading for new developers, and also acting as a way to self-validate code that is being written.  Because JavaScript is loosely typed, it's impossible to know what types of objects a function expects without either a) knowing the code base, b) logging what variables are passed into the function.\r\n\r\nCode that is annotated and documented with the JSDoc format can have documentation dynamically generated.  There are already a couple of tools available that do this:\r\n\r\n* [JSDoc itself](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc).  Some examples of generated documentation: [jaguarjs-jsdoc](http://davidshimjs.github.io/jaguarjs/doc), [docstra](http://terryweiss.github.io/docstrap/themes/spacelab/).\r\n* [dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni).  Used to generate the entire [AngularJS documentation page](https://docs.angularjs.org/api).\r\n\r\nFor an example of what a fully fleshed out file with documentation looks like have a look at [Ember's Component.js file](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages_es6/ember-views/lib/views/component.js).  I'm not sure what Ember uses to generate their documentation, or what format they use, but that could be a good solution as well.\r\n\r\nI know we used groc in the past, which uses literate programming to document itself.  I do not have that much experience with literate programming but from what I've seen of it, and from what I've seen of Ghost's codebase, it would seem that JSDoc style documentation would be of greater help to the code base and to new developers.  Additionally the ecosystem around JSDoc style documentation is stronger, with many more tools available to allow us to get moving at a faster speed.\r\n\r\nI feel like getting Ghost's code base documented will really help both existing and new devs, as well as make the code itself more robust.

2610,'ErisDS',"[Discussion] Options vs Args for API methods\nMost methods across the API take at least one argument, and usually just the one. There is vast inconsistency between how these arguments are named.\r\n\r\nThe argument, in the majority of cases, is a big smooshed together JS object containing all of the data that may have been sent to the API. This is because much of the time, the API is requested over HTTP in which case the [requestHandler](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/api/index.js#L46) creates the options argument by merging together the request body, any files, any query parameters and any url parameters. \r\n\r\nIn many cases this is treated like it is just the request body, containing an object to add or edit. In this case the argument is often named after the type of object and suffixed with `Data`, so in the user API the argument is called `userData` and in the post API it is called `postData`.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the argument is called `options` or `args`.\r\n\r\nSome API methods, particularly some of the less RESTful user methods for managing passwords, take multiple arguments.\r\n\r\nThe end goal here is to simplify what arguments the API takes, to clarify what they are for each method, and to make sure they are consistently named and used regardless of whether the method gets called via a route or internally.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of different things we could do here. \r\n\r\nOne possibility would be to specify that API methods only ever take one argument, call it `options` and document what options **must** and **may** contain for each method.\r\n\r\nA different approach would be to consider the object separately to any possible options. Change the `requestHandler` to keep the `req.body` separate, merge together `req.query` and `req.params` and do something clear and consistent with `req.files`. Then the method signature for each method would be `method(object, options)`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best option is a hybrid approach where each method still only takes a single argument (let's call it `request`) and this contains structures for the main object and any options. The newly updated post API's `edit` method takes an argument called `postData` which looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n   posts: [ \r\n        {\r\n            status: 'draft',\r\n            title: 'Testing Titles\r\n            ...,\r\n            author: [Object],\r\n            fields: []\r\n        }\r\n   ],\r\n   id: '143' \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than leaving id + any other url params, query params or files out in the cold, lets wrap them in a `meta` object the same as we would with a response?\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n   posts: [{...}],\r\n   meta: {\r\n       id: '143' \r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr for an example with query params:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n   settings: [{...}],\r\n   meta: {\r\n       type: 'blog,theme,app' \r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the meta object would be confusing or not? So putting this out for discussion before we do any work.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the decision made, the output from this issue should be:\r\n\r\n* All arguments to all API methods named the same\r\n* Clear documentation on what **must** and **may** appear in the arguments for each method"

This would mean that 4 parameters will be passed to the filter.\r\n\r\n`prePostRender` should also provide information about the context where the post is rendered - an app might decide to render a post differently when rendered for an RSS feed or an email. Do we need predefined named contexts (like: `mail`, `rss`, `frontend`) to allow filters to behave according to the context they’re applied in? Right now `prePostRender` is applied both to render posts for the frontend and for rss feeds.\r\n\r\nI would like to get a discussion going on how contextual data should be passed to filters.\r\n\r\nI have two solutions in mind:\r\n\r\n1. Pass all data as an array, with the object that should be filtered in the first spot:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    filters.doFilter('name', [object, post, tag, page]);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.

This allows sending the 'openModal' action from any template to open a modal.\r\n\r\n- Every modal template lives in 'templates/modals/{{modalName}}'\r\n\r\n- Each modal can have a backing controller of the same name that can provide additional control for that modal.  Those controllers reside in 'controllers/modals/{{modalName}}'\r\n\r\n- Created the ModalDialog component which is where all the logic for the component resides.  It's not at 100% parity with the existing Ghost modal system but it has the foundation for further fleshing out.  It currently accepts parameters for styling how the modal should appear, which previously was defined in JS files in the Backbone admin.\r\n\r\n- This creates the 'delete all posts', 'delete this post', 'markdown', and 'upload' modal.  Some are in more stages of completion than others, but I wanted to just get the foundation in place as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n- This also creates the UploadModal component which is a subclass of the ModalDialog component.  The reason for this subclassing is that the UploadModal component directly accesses the DOM and when that occurs in Ember it should remain in a component definition.

A number of interactive items, such as notifications, popover menus, and modals are candidates for being components in Ghost-UI. By moving these items to Ghost-UI it becomes possible for us to reuse the styling and interactions across the Ghost admin, Ghost Apps, Ghost.org, the Marketplace, Documentation and any other Ghost properties, as well as allowing the community to make use of it in their own projects.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that Ember does not automatically play nicely with jQuery components, so we need to think about how we can make the Ember.js Ghost Admin, and Ghost-UI play nicely together:\r\n\r\n* Does it still make sense to separate out these components in this way? \r\n* Will we need Ember.js wrappers?\r\n* If so, what should they look like?\r\n* Is there another way to achieve our goals (reusability).'

This issue attempts to quantify and explain all the ways in which they are confusing / broken.. and then get that fixed:\r\n\r\n### The image preview extension\r\nLocated at: `/core/client/assets/lib/showdown/extensions/ghostdown.js`\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\n\r\n* Is poorly named 'ghostdown' even though it actually isn't a ghost version of markdown at all, but just the code which transforms normal image markdown `![]()` into the placeholder for uploading\r\n* Is located in `core/client/assets` because it is used in the admin UI only - frontend UI should show a normal image or nothing.\r\n* Oddly contains the 4-or-more-underscore 'fix' which means this is only happening client side - no idea how I missed this, this should always have been in the GFM extension\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n\r\n* rename it to ghostImagePreview - that's what it is\r\n* move it to `/shared/` with the other extensions, even though it's only used in the admin client, this will be far less confusing. I can never find it and I wrote it!\r\n* move the 4-or-more-underscore 'fix' and tests to the GFM extension\r\n\r\n### The GFM extension\r\n\r\nLocated at: `/core/shared/lib/showdown/extensions/github.js`\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\n\r\n* poorly named, originally started out as showdown's own `github.js` extension but has had a great deal of additions and amendments such that having the same name is now confusing\r\n* it's buggy as hell! A large number of the [editor bugs](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?direction=desc&labels=bug%2Ceditor&milestone=&page=1&sort=created&state=open) come from this file, and in particular the logic of whether something should be pre or post processed or processed with certain blocks extracted\r\n* the file is under-commented and probably under-tested - given it's complexity and importance\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n\r\n* Rename it to 'ghostGFM' to make it clear that this is a custom implementation of GFM features\r\n* Look through the list of [editor bugs](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?direction=desc&labels=bug%2Ceditor&milestone=&page=1&sort=created&state=open) , and kill anything that's a quick win (with lots of tests)\r\n* Add a crap-tonne of comments\r\n* Look for missing edge-cases in tests\r\n\r\n### The Typography extension\r\n\r\nLocated at: `/core/shared/lib/showdown/extensions/typography.js`\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\n\r\n* When it was added, it wasn't added to the integration tests, thus it actually breaks a tonne of things and we didn't know so it needs to be tested (See #2312)\r\n* It breaks stuff so it needs to be fixed (See #2312)\r\n* It's not versioned or in bower :(\r\n* Because of the use of fonts on the editor, it isn't being put to good use (See https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI/issues/12)\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n\r\n* Add it to our integrated showdown tests\r\n* Fix the problems with it\r\n* Try to get a version added / it added to bower (See https://github.com/caerphoto/showdown_typography/issues/2)\r\n* Get the editor fonts changed (See https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost-UI/issues/12)"

2366,'',"[Proposal] Apps should use manifest.json instead of package.json\nThis issue is related to #2095\r\n\r\nCurrently the plan is for Ghost Apps to have a package.json, this file will declare various meta data about the App. Including name, description, keywords, an icon etc.\r\n\r\nThis will likely be extending in the future so the package.json also declares things like the Apps permissions, among others.\r\n\r\nHowever I think using a package.json has various issues \r\n\r\n* It has the potential to have clashing properties, since the same file will also be used by npm to install the Apps dependencies (although this can be worked-around).\r\n* To avoid clashing with npm Ghost related metadata could be nested in a Ghost object.\r\nAlthough this would work, it just seems wrong - Why is Ghost playing second fiddle to npm? especially considering the author is writing a Ghost App and not an npm module.\r\n* It will overload the package.json meaning, ending-up with a situation where package.json will be used for purposes it was not originally designed. \r\n* It semantically not meaningful - why is an App using a package file to declare meta-data about itself?\r\n\r\nI propose that all apps should instead be required to declare a manifest.json. \r\nI didn't make-up this name, its a convention used by other projects for example [Google Chrome](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/) requires a manifest.json when writing apps/extension . This is also used by [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest).\r\n\r\nOptionally apps can also use package.json if the App has npm dependencies and possibly even a bower.json if the App has client-side dependencies that live on the bower registry.\r\n"

The difference between the two helpers is that one strips html and the other doesn\'t.\r\n\r\nSo what if instead of having the "excerpt" helper, we had "strip_html" as an option for the "content" helper?\r\n\r\nThe functions of the two helpers could then be combined into one, with the processing method and returned value depending on the "strip_html" setting, and it could be used in a theme like:\r\n\r\n{{content characters / words="100" strip_html="true / false"}}\r\n\r\n(The "strip_html" property would default to false.

2322,'','Split Ghost into two applications?\nLet me preface by saying \r\n\r\n> Not been one of the core devs, am properly really wrong about this.\r\n\r\nI think the problems outlined by @ErisDS in #2144 stem from a conflict between two major parts of Ghost, namely Ghost the Blog part and Ghost the Admin part.\r\n\r\nThe Admin part is a modern, advanced web application. And requires appropriate tools and techniques to build it.\r\n\r\nThe Blog part in stark contrast is a quite simple website. Consisting of just two pages (the home page and post page). This is by design as using other techniques would likely lead to **unacceptable** side-effects like poor seo.\r\n\r\nI think it\'s these opposing approaches to building an application that has\r\n\r\n> resulting in confusion between what goes where, and code split between the client and the server.\r\n\r\nSo given this situation wouldn\'t it make sense to split Ghost into two applications?\r\n\r\n**Ghost**\r\nAn express app, serves the home page, the post page and api endpoints. Would have limited client-side functionality but continue to use backbone for structure.\r\n\r\n**Ghost Admin**\r\nA full-on single page application, using the ember framework. Without the constraints of living within the same repo as the Ghost Blog, Ghost Admin can simply adopt the conventions (especially directory structure) provided by a framework like ember. This way the whole "what goes where" issue, should disappear.\r\n\r\n**Ghost Apps**\r\nHaving not seen any Ghost Apps and how they are architected, am not sure how this approach would effect them. But perhaps it would help to simplify them. Ghost Apps will have to **"make-up the mind"**, they will either be a Ghost Blog App (enhance the user facing frontend in someway) or Ghost Admin App (help the blogger better manage his/her blog on the backend.)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** When I say split Ghost into two applications, I don\'t mean to imply that the user has to go and download two apps. Ghost Admin will automatically packaged into the main app (similar to how Casper is pulled in) and would be proxied/accessible at **/admin**.\r\n'

Perhaps you have a partial which outputs posts for both the index and post templates, but you want to change one detail - there is no way to tell, using handlebars, whether the current context is a post list or single page, or whether it's the homepage or an archive page or a tag page list.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what if I want to output the first 2 posts in the list in full, rather than just the first one? \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any more examples of similar use-cases where context awareness would be useful?"
2248,'','Preview link to draft post\nGhost makes it extremely easy to preview markdown in real time, but what if we want more than that? For example, a user might want to add Mathjax support in the website and want to see the LaTeX code rendered on the preview pane as they are typing. This is currently not supported because the user needs to fiddle with file such as `ghost/core/server/views/default.hbs` to make sure Mathjax can be loaded and they can see the preview. This is not practical in all scenarios, for example, some users don\'t want to change the existing code in order to get the custom preview working.\r\n\r\nSo right now, a user has to "preview" the post by publishing it first and by manually loading it in the browser. What I am proposing is, why don\'t we add a feature to Ghost that will let the preview to be rendered without publishing the post/page first? So users can preview their post (if they are logged in admin) by going to `/preview/{post-slug}`. I think that would be nice. WordPress also has this feature and it\'s quite nice to have it.'

I\'d also like the community\'s help in determining how to expose the API as understandably as possible!\r\n\r\nThe idea is to let you make sure that the `{{content}}` snippets used for summarizing a post on the index page aren\'t cut mid-sentence or mid-paragraph.\r\n\r\nCurrently you can use `{{content words="55"}}` or `{{content characters="55"}}` to get a post snippet with 55 words or characters respectively. As is implied by their names, they will also cut off sentences and words half way through. This leads to snippets like the following from the ghost blog:\r\n\r\n> Today we\'re very pleased to announce an all new look and feel, right here, for the official Ghost blog.\r\n>\r\n> Up until now, our official blog had been running a completely standard implementation of the default Casper theme which ships with every copy of Ghost. It worked very well, to get us started, but we\'ve always…\r\n\r\nThis seems great for some types of themes and content but undesirable for others.\r\n\r\nI have a change prototyped that would let you set a flag to indicate that the markdown paragraph in which the word limit is met should complete anyway. Effectively letting you set the \'fuzzy\' length of the snippet and letting you be sure that content won\'t be clipped mid-sentence.\r\n\r\nUsing this setting would make the previous snippet from the ghost blog come out as follows (and have 76, not 55 words):\r\n\r\n > Today we\'re very pleased to announce an all new look and feel, right here, for the official Ghost blog.\r\n>\r\n> Up until now, our official blog had been running a completely standard implementation of the default Casper theme which ships with every copy of Ghost. It worked very well, to get us started, but we\'ve always wanted to have something a little more custom that\'s a part of the rest of Ghost.org and properly integrates our branding.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound useful to anyone?\r\n\r\nAs far as API goes, I\'m thinking something like this:\r\n`{{content words="55" rounding="markdown-block"}}`\r\nOther values would, for starters, only include the default `none` which would correspond to the current behavior.\r\nI\'m suggesting `markdown-block` instead of say, `paragraph` because the functionality currently makes sure lists and some other high level markdown blocks are also completed (p, ul, ol, blockquote, and pre).\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like an understandable API? Is there anything you would change?\r\n\r\nAny and all feedback would be greatly appreciated!'

2166,'','[Feature] Improved post excerpts / previews\n(This issue is primarily intended to spark conversation and gauge interest!)\r\n\r\nMost themes i\'ve seen use {{excerpt}} for post snippets. Some use {{content words="#"}} or {{contents characters="#"}}. All of these options are lackluster as they remove context or content, and offer no control of the process.\r\n\r\nAn improved API would be awesome. I see two primary options:\r\n1. Preview annotation\r\n2. Context sensitive {{content}} blocks\r\n\r\nPreview annotation could be <!-- preview --> or some nicer syntax to wrap or designate the end of the text to be shown in the preview. It could perhaps even allow for content separate from that shown in the actual post. The preview could be made available to themes with an API like {{preview}}. This could be good for writers who want to carefully craft their preview blocks. (This functionality sounds like it might be great for developing as plugin, at least initially.)\r\n\r\nContext sensitivity in {{content}} (and {{excerpt}}) blocks is more interesting. It could make sense as default functionality, serving initially to just do better than chop text mid-sentence. Ghost could provide an API like {{content max-words="#"}} and attempt to more intelligently do sub-contenting within requested bounds.\r\nTo some extent, this could *perhaps* be offloaded to the Downsize script that Ghost is currently using (and I\'m going to look into it!), but Downsize\'s job is to take arbitrary html and return shortened html and in working within that bound it both loses contextual hints from markdown, and is forced not to make assumptions that would be solid for Ghost. (For example, that the input is HTML that *can* be generated by markdown).\r\nPerhaps snippeting could be done better in markdown itself? That obviously has a whole host of problems though!'

One way to accelerate this process is with the use of an XML-RPC to ping various services and let them know that a new post exists. \r\n\r\nThere are various extents to which this can be implemented. WordPress ships with a single service (pingomatic) - and mostly SEO-boffs ramp that up to 50+ services (overkill).\r\n\r\nI would suggest that we implement a default, behind the scenes RPC connection which pings the 3 most popular services - any further modification to enable or disable more or less services should then be done via apps.\r\n\r\nThis is the list of what I believe is generally considered to be the top 3:\r\n\r\n1. http://rpc.pingomatic.com\r\n2. http://blogsearch.google.com/ping/RPC2\r\n3. http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping *(looks dead, but I believe it actually only responds to POST requests)*\r\n\r\nWe can review adding more by default later if it seems sensible, but 3 is probably a good starting point.\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth looking closely at how WordPress does this for reference.

2144,'',"[Discussion] The future of Ghost's admin UI\nThere has been much discussion, originally starting here: #951, and most recently in [IRC](http://107.20.237.151:8081/logs/%23ghost/20140128#pm63558) around the future of Ghost's admin UI and the frameworks and tools that it should use.\r\n\r\nThis discussion is driven by a number of problems that are present in the existing implementation. Any discussion around solutions needs to carefully to consider all the problems that we face in the admin:\r\n\r\n1. The admin is halfway between a one-page app, and a multi-page app, resulting in confusion between what goes where, and code split between the client and the server. \r\n1. The confusion and disarray has lead to really poor mobile support\r\n1. A complete lack of data binding, leading to code like [this](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/0.4.1/core/client/views/settings.js#L157) (see #550)\r\n1. No memory management for views (views are never destroyed) (see #951)\r\n1. Views are doing transitions (animations) manually (see #951)\r\n1. Really ugly routing (see #951)\r\n1. Most of our stuff is rendered client side, but is this bad? [interesting article](http://tomdale.net/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-dead/)\r\n1. Our code is really really fragile. It's easy to break saving, or uploading, or something else critical.\r\n\r\n### Discussion point 1: What other problems does the admin suffer from? Can you help us better quantify any of these problems?\r\n\r\nIt would be great to develop a set of principles / statements that need to be true for any new solution like:\r\n\r\n- Data-binding is handled automatically.\r\n- Sub-page routing is easy\r\n\r\nDo you have examples of bits of the admin UI that you think are particularly dire? Are their problems you anticipate we might have if we moved from Backbone? Etc..\r\n\r\n### Discussion point 2: What is the best structure for a complex client side app like this?\r\n\r\nThis sort of depends on the tool used to build it, but also has implications for choosing a tool.\r\n\r\nIs the Ghost admin a single page app, or a collection of single page apps? If you take the dashboard into consideration, I believe that alone is a single page app. The editor is probably the same. \r\n\r\nDo you have ideas on how to structure the admin UI, and how to ensure it works as a whole?\r\n\r\n### Discussion point 3: Is backbone the best framework for the job?\r\n\r\nThere are many other potential tools we could use, and there are a few main solutions that we consider to be on the table:\r\n\r\n1. Improving the current [backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org/) implementation by adding more underlying structure and using additional tools like [marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) and [rendr](https://github.com/airbnb/rendr)\r\n1. Switching to [emberjs](http://emberjs.com/)\r\n1. Switching to [angular](http://angularjs.org/)\r\n1. Something else entirely?\r\n\r\nDo you have some relevant experience with one of these solutions that you can tell us about? Are you able to put together a code example or demo that shows what it might look like, or specifically how a problem is solved?\r\n\r\nDo you have time to implement a more complete demo / example of one of the key features, like the editor, or the post-settings menu?\r\n \r\n### Please note:\r\n\r\nDiscussions on topics like these can be hard to keep objective, so I'm going to lay out some ground rules. Comments on this issue should contribute something of real value to one of the above discussion points:\r\n- experience or insight that is relevant to one of the discussion points\r\n- an interesting article providing insight on how other people have solved \r\n- a demo or code example showing how a tool could solve a relevant problem\r\n\r\nPlease do not post subjective comments suggesting which is your preferred framework, and although we all know the hamster IS a valid reason to choose ember, please keep those sorts of comments to IRC (please)! I have the power to delete comments, and for this thread, I may make use of it without warning :smiling_imp:\r\n\r\n### Next steps:\r\n\r\nThis is a call to action for our community, a place to come to put your thoughts, ideas, examples and other contributions.

Linked object support will be added in the future via some sort of switch. \r\n\r\nThe move towards the [JSON API response format](http://jsonapi.org/) includes a number of distinct changes:\r\n\r\n- The response is an object with a number of keys, one of those keys should be the pluralised name of the primary document type which is being returned. In terms of Ghost, this means `posts`, `tags`, `users`, `settings` etc.\r\n- The response object can also contain a `meta` key, this will be used to return pagination data\r\n- The key for the primary document type always contains an array, even when only one object is returned. Therefore the response for a single post would look like: `{ posts: [{ id: 1, uuid: ... } ] }`\r\n- Related objects should default to using their relation name as the key. Therefore in the post response, there should be an `author` key, not an `author_id` key.\r\n- Related objects should only be exanded into full objects when explicitly declared with `include`.\r\n- The headers on the response should include a content-type header of 'application/vnd.api+json', 'application/json'.\r\n- The response to a create request should include a location header like Location: `http://my`blog.com/ghost/api/posts/12`\r\n- The keys for pagination data should be moved into a top-level `meta` object\r\n- We should add support for PATCH requests (long term)\r\n- We should add support for the sort query param (long term)\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few changes, some of them bigger and harder than others, the following is a list of issues which should get us from where we are to where we want to be.\r\n\r\n- [x] Move to primary document format: Posts ~~#2580~~, Tags~~ #2605~~, Users ~~#2593~~, Settings ~~#2606~~, DB #2647?, Mail #2650?,\r\n- [x] Notifications API: Proper endpoints for persistent notifications #2637\r\n- [x] Tag API: parent relation #2607\r\n- [x] Post API: author relation #2608\r\n- [x] Post API: pagination -> meta #2604\r\n- [x] Post API: Explicit includes #2609\r\n- [ ] Non-REST function / route names #2601\r\n- [x] Options vs Args #2610\r\n- [x] Internal cleanup / consistency\r\n- [x] Provide proper status codes for API operations #2187\r\n- [x] Error messages ~~#2643~~, #2690\r\n- [ ] Complete documentation #2125\r\n"

2115,'halfdan','The `{{#has}}` block helper\nNote: Originally discussed in #1574 and #1562 \r\n\r\nThe idea for the `has` block helper is the result of much discussion, and is an attempt to provide the tools theme developers need to do different things based upon the context they are in.\r\n\r\nWe deliberately and specifically avoid logic in templates where possible. Handlebars only allows boolean conditionals. The `has` helper is generic enough to solve many scenarios for Ghost theme devs, whilst still not entering into the murky land of defining what is pretty much an entire programming language.\r\n\r\nThe intention is that the `has` helper will allow you to ask questions about the object in the current context. Starting with asking questions about what tags the current post has like:\r\n\r\nIf the current post has the tag \'funny\':\r\n```\r\n{{#post}}\r\n    {{#has tag="funny"}}\r\n        ... do something with all the posts which have a tag of funny ...\r\n    {{else}}\r\n        ... do something with all the posts which don\'t have a tag of funny ...\r\n    {{/has}}\r\n{{/post}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe attribute `tag` allows for asking questions about tags. With just one tag provided it checks for just the single tag. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are other formats available for asking other questions \r\n\r\nIf the post has the tags \'funny\' **or** \'video\':\r\n`{{#has tag="funny, video"}}...{{/has}}`\r\n\r\nIf the post has the tags \'funny\' **and** \'video\':\r\n`{{#has tag="funny & video"}}...{{/has}}`\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, the **and** and **or** forms cannot be used together. \r\n\r\nAs a block helper, `has` needs to support inversing so that the **not** form of any question can be done by using handlebars\' `^` or `else` syntaxes:\r\n\r\n`{{^has tag="funny, video"}}...{{/has}}`\r\n`{{#has tag="funny, video"}}...{{else}}...{{/has}}`\r\n'

2095,'jgable',"App Permissions\nRef: [App Ideas Permissions](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/App-Ideas-Permissions) and #2007 \r\n\r\nWe want applications to be able to define the permissions they require to work. These permissions cover api / acl style CRUD permissions on models, like add post, edit user, and also potentially more general permissions on non-objects like 'add route'.\r\n\r\nThese permissions are used in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. for implementing access control throughout Ghost see #2059\r\n2. to present to the user when installing a theme, to give the user visibility on what an app might be doing.\r\n\r\nWe need a way for apps to define what permissions it needs. This needs to be accessible throughout the application so that the ACL tools can read & check against them.\r\n\r\nUser ACL exists in the form of roles, permissions, user_roles, user_permissions, and role_permissions tables in the database.\r\n\r\nThe first problem that we need to solve is how should apps define their permissions? Is having their own config.js as suggested by [App Ideas Permissions](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/App-Ideas-Permissions) the best solution? Or could this be done in package.json?\r\nThe main difference being that a .js file can contain JavaScript, and that a package.json has a specified format and is used by other things, so might end up with its own permissions option which would clash.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is how to make these permissions available to the application. Is loading the permissions object / array into memory enough or should we load these into the database?\r\n\r\nAs a result of this issue, I'd like to see a defined spec for a basic set of app permissions and how to define them on the wiki, as well as implementing the loading of these permissions in the app loader."

If it is we should create it, but with the supplied value, if it isn't we should not create it and we should return saying the setting was invalid.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter where the request comes from, these rules should occur.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n\r\nIf the request is not internal any request to edit, read, add or browse a setting with type 'core' will return an access denied type error message. \r\n\r\nAll settings API methods should be protected by standard ACL, allowing us to deny access to certain settings for different user groups.\r\n\r\nThe only question here is whether or not Apps would validly need to know what databaseVersion Ghost is currently running. If this is true, then we need to find a different way to deny access to the dbHash."
2060,'',"ACL: Add to model-based API methods: posts, tags, users\nMuch of the post API already has access control, but this needs to be completed.\r\n\r\nAll methods in the `post` API should have access control, including `browse` and `read`. This will involve ensuring that `canThis` will work in a way that supports anybody (inc null user) having access to the published posts, and only the admin user having access to the non published posts.\r\n\r\nGiven that we also have to consider adding ACL for apps #2059, it may be worth extending the concept of `apiContext` to include where the request is coming from - if it's an internal server side request from Ghost, from an App, or a client side request. This may provide us with a way to specify that the client side context has access to all published posts etc.\r\n\r\nAll methods in the user and tags APIs should also have ACL added to them, which should be reasonably straightforward. The settings API is a little bit more tricky and should be dealt with by a separate issue (#2061).\r\n\r\n"
2059,'jgable',"ACL for Apps\nAs per the explanation here: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/App-Ideas-Permissions#wiki-permissions\r\n\r\nWe want to make it possible for Apps to register for permissions in the same way that users have permissions. Those permissions are enforced in various places, most importantly in the API.\r\n\r\nApps need to make internal requests to the API methods via the proxy object. \r\n\r\nTherefore we need a way to:\r\n\r\n1. Determine or define which app is making the request. \r\n     - This should probably be an extension of the apiContext (see #2058) as we still need to know on behalf of which user the request is being made.\r\n2. Determine what permissions the app has.\r\n    - This should probably be done by fetching those permissions from the correct app's config\r\n3. Provide a way to ask if the current app and the current user have permission to perform the action they are trying to perform\r\n    - This should likely be an extension of canThis, which takes a more complex context than a single user. `canThis({app: 'my-app', user: 1}).edit.post(2);\r\n\r\nIt's important to deal with permissions for both the app and the user, as otherwise in future it could be possible for a less privileged user to use an app to do things they shouldn't be able to."
2058,'sebgie',"ACL & the API: Current user everywhere\nIn order to roll out full access control, we need to update, improve and fix the concept of `apiContext` which exists in the [API request handler](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/api/index.js#L47).\r\n\r\nCurrently API context is set to:\r\n\r\n> `user: req.session && req.session.user`\r\n\r\nThis is wrong, by accident, the `&&` evaluates to `true` which evaluates to `1` which is the correct user ID in the majority of cases, but I believe this should really be:\r\n\r\n> `user: req.session && req.session.user ? req.session.user : null`\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we need to consider how to pass this concept of user through to every action which makes a change on a model, so that the `created_by`, `updated_by` and other user id's are set correctly."
2057,'hswolff',"Support for additional permalink structures\nCurrently, Ghost supports the following permalink structures:\r\n\r\n* Standard: `/:slug/`\r\n* Dated: `/:year/:month/:day/:slug/`\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier for people to move their blogs from other platforms to Ghost, we want to support any permalink structure which contains any of the following items:\r\n\r\n* `:slug`\r\n* `:id` \r\n* `:year`\r\n* `:month`\r\n* `:day`\r\n* santised custom text containing a-z, 0-9, - or _\r\n\r\nTo be a valid permalink, each item must be separated by a '/', and there should be a maximum of 5 items. the permalink must contain one of `:slug` or `:id` so that the post can be identified.\r\n\r\nSo I could set my blog posts to have a URL like any of these:\r\n\r\n* `/:year/:month/:slug/\r\n* `/:year/:slug/\r\n* `/blogpost/:id/\r\n* `/post/:year/:month/:day/:slug/`\r\n\r\nAt the completion of this issue, Ghost should support these structures if the permalink setting is modified directly in the DB. The UI for configuring the permalink in admin is covered by issue #1631. \r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\n\r\nSome things we should consider for the future are:\r\n* whether or not to support adding `.html` to the end of URLs so that imports from blogger work, \r\n* whether to import custom data and allow that in the URL, like the id which is in tumblr URLs\r\n\r\nWe do want to make it possible to have an app that does mass re-writing/redirecting of URLs... so we could solve these problems by having an app 301 redirect the .html out of blogger urls, and the id out of tumblr urls, in which case blogger becomes `/:year/:month/:slug/` and blogger becomes `/post/:slug/`or even the default `/:slug/`.\r\n"

Apparently ghost or more likely the node.js webserver catches that quite nicely, but then fails to display the 400 page.\r\n\r\nThe same error doesn\'t happen in the 0.3.3 version and it doesn\'t seem to happen on Linux installations of Ghost (for example it doesn\'t happen on my ghost install on runkite).\r\n\r\nWhen running in production mode, the server displays a generic bad request message (but still has the exception), when running in development mode, the stack trace is shown in the error 400 page.\r\n\r\nThe exception looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Cannot find module \'hbs\'\r\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)\r\n    at Module.require (module.js:364:17)\r\n    at require (module.js:380:17)\r\n    at new View (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\node_modules\\express\\lib\\view.js:43:49)\r\n    at Function.app.render (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\node_modules\\express\\lib\\application.js:486:12)\r\n    at ServerResponse.res.render (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\node_modules\\express\\lib\\response.js:798:7)\r\n    at renderErrorInt (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\core\\server\\errorHandling.js:162:30)\r\n    at Object.errors.renderErrorPage (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\core\\server\\errorHandling.js:179:16)\r\n    at Object.errors.error500 (C:\\Projects\\Ghost\\ghost-git\\Ghost\\core\\server\\errorHandling.js:206:20)\r\nGET /%c0%af 400 72ms - 831b\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do not know of any web testing environments that actually support running node.js in Windows (Travis-ci has a lengthy thread that this would be desirable, but they have not yet implemented it), so I cannot be sure if this is caused by something specific to my machine, but I don\'t think it is.\r\n\r\n'

Install Ghost 0.4-pre3\r\n2. Load admin panel, notice super awesome friendly update notification.\r\n3. Upgrade to Ghost 0.4\r\n4. Load admin panel again. Notice the super awesome friendly update notification isn't gone :(.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug because upgrading Ghost should clear the update notification.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's caused because when the update checker checks, it sets nextUpdateCheck in the settings table to the next date the update checker should run (really good idea). It also sets displayUpdateNotification if ghost should display a notification.

JSLint does provide some of this functionality however there's some definitions that it lacks that jscs provides, such as:\r\n\r\n* [requiring curly braces around keywords](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs#requirecurlybraces)\r\n* [requiring `var` be used once when declaring](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs#requiremultiplevardecl)\r\n* [require aligned object values](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs#requirealignedobjectvalues)\r\n* [disallow trailing whitespace](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs#requirealignedobjectvalues)\r\n\r\nBecause Ghost is a community developed project it incorporates the coding styles of all those contributions.  This is fine, and good, however it'd also be healthy to encourage a coding standard across the code base so as to increase the overall maintainability of the project.  Should help with getting new developers up to speed as everything is similar in style, and should reduce any errors due to that same reason.\r\n\r\nAlso has a grunt plugin as well.  https://github.com/gustavohenke/grunt-jscs-checker\r\n"

Start writing a new blogpost with the following content:\r\n\r\n    \\#\\# Some title\r\n    !![]()\r\n\r\n5. Click on the inserted placeholder.\r\n6.

Because the first request is not finished yet, the test whether there's already a user present in the system will fail, so Ghost will process the request as if there wasn't, trying to add a new user. Meanwhile the first request finishes, adds the user, and the second request is halfway through. That will mean that the second request got past Ghost's check, and encounters nasty database constraints, resulting in epic failure.

What should it/they be called? How would you expect to pass in the set of tags, and how would you differentiate between having and not having, and checking for any tag or all tags in the set?\r\n\r\nHere\'s an example of what it might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{#has_tags "my-tag-1" "my other tag" any="true"}}\r\n  ... do something here...\r\n{{else}}\r\n  ... do something else here...\r\n{{/has_tags}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the name of the tag is `has_tags` and this works for one or many. The set of tags are `"my-tag-1" "my other tag"`. Setting the option `any` to true means that the tag will return true, or rather execute the first block if the post has any of the given tags, rather than testing for all of them.\r\n\r\nWhen making suggestions, please keep in mind what is and is not possible with handlebars helpers.'

It does not allow you to pass in a config object, that will require a separate PR (and require #1390 to land first, so the location of our files can be relative to the file instantiating ghost).  This is the first step towards getting to the ultimate goal of allowing ghost to be used as a module, one that I think is a good step towards that ultimate goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works from a separate file where you can do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar ghost = require('ghost');\r\nghost();\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar ghost = require('ghost'),\r\n    express = require('express');\r\nghost(express());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is mostly accomplished by changing `./core/server` to have it's functionality enclosed in functions, instead of having them execute as soon as the module is included elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt also requires two different code paths:\r\n  1. When ghost is ran from the CLI it delegates to the `./index.js` file to start the ghost app.\r\n  2. When ghost is ran as a npm module from a seperate file, it leverages `package.json`'s `main` property to dictate what file is included. \r\n\r\nThis is also built on top of my previous #1444, so that needs to be merged before this one can.\r\n\r\nSorry for the size of the PR, hope it's manageable enough to get merged.

1499,'',"Signup > Signin UX\n### The Problem\r\n\r\nWe are getting many reports of users unable to sign in to Ghost after signing up #1469.\r\n\r\nI believe this is caused, in part, by the disjoint between signing up and signing in - a users signs up, and is automatically signed in, and may not need to use their sign in details for some time - thus never knowing if they mistyped something and otherwise having lots of time to forget what they did.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Ghost forced you to sign in straight after signing up, so you had to use your details again - this way you pretty much knew straight away if you had typo'd.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of ease of use, it is much better UX to sign the user in automatically after sign up. However this is a one-time event, and forcing users to enter their credentials may be a better way to catch issues with typos in email addresses and passwords.\r\n\r\n### Potential changes \r\n\r\nThe common way of mitigating this is to duplicate the important email and password fields. This is a bit clunky, but again, we're talking about a one-time thing. Potentially, this is more likely to create a barrier / put people off, than asking them to sign in after they have signed up.\r\n\r\nAnother option could be to provide additional UI after signup - showing a dialog which displays the user's email and allows them to check and confirm their password if they want to or otherwise strongly messaging the user to double check their typing. Not sure if this is done in many places.\r\n\r\nYet another method would be to message more strongly if email is not available at this point to try to encourage users to configure email, and then send a welcome email (not including the password)... this is a bit rubbish though because if the user gets their email wrong they don't get the email and the lack of email is unlikely to work as a useful indicator of someone spelling their email address incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAll of this is a one-time event for each user that they have to go through. Making it easy by not having duplicate fields and not requiring both sign up and sign in is probably more helpful for developers who have to go through this process more frequently, than it is for the end user who does it once, gets it wrong, and then gets utterly confused.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue is here to consider the best option. In my opinion the best option is to not automagically sign users in - the 2 steps force users to consider if they did it wrong straight away, rather than coming back and assuming they've been 'locked out'. I also think it's better than duplicating the fields up front... but I've nothing to back this up."

One thing that I think would make life easier for the core team and others like me who want to contribute would be to get a bit more idiomatic with Ghost\'s internals. Specifically - following the mantra "do one thing well".\r\n\r\nTo that end, I would love to contribute to this and open a PR for tracking, but I wanted to check with the team first. My specific ideas are separating the modules along these lines:\r\n\r\n - ghost-core (all the main logic and data maneuvering)\r\n - ghost-admin (the admin views, routes, client code etc - note that this isn\'t a full express site, just the hooks)\r\n - ghost-rest (the JSON api)\r\n - ghost-caspar (the Caspar theme)\r\n - ghost-express (the web site which pulls in all of these modules)\r\n\r\nOne nice benefit of doing this is that it makes theming a lot more extensible and puts the installation and management of themes into NPM which can manage *everything* for you instead of leaning on git submodules (which can be rather opaque).\r\n\r\nAnother nice thing is that it unbolts HBS from ... well everything. If a theme wants to use HBS then... hurrah. Otherwise it could use Jade or EJS etc.\r\n\r\nIf I don\'t want a REST api, I don\'t need to add the package and hook it up in the app.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re up for exploring this - I\'m happy to contribute my time. I\'d also like to rev the admin site to using something a bit more current like Ember or Angular. This would help scale that lovely thing - but I\'ll pop this into another PR if you\'re game.\r\n\r\nMany thanks again for all your work.\r\n\r\n\r\n'

1454,'',"Refactor Notifications\nGhost has a few different types of notifications, most commonly these are referred to as **passive** and **persistent** notifications. \r\n\r\nThere is also some confusion with regard to how notifications do or should work, as some are private (cannot be shown when logged in), some get created on the server side, some on the client side, most can be dismissed, some cannot, and some are stored in memory via the API and some are not. Most of them appear in the same place and are indistinguishable, with the exception of the upgrade notification.\r\n\r\nThe following is the specification for how Notifications should work once the API and Ember.js projects are completed. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Passive Notifications\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n![success](http://puu.sh/8iL8l.png)\r\n![failure](http://puu.sh/8iL8T.png)\r\n\r\n#### Description:\r\nPassive notifications are created by the client-side single page app, as a result of user interactions. They are used to show short-term notifications such as your post being saved successfully, and to indicate errors. \r\n\r\n#### Creation:\r\nPassive notifications are only ever stored in the DOM, they do not persist past the next user interaction such as a request or screen-change. For example any notifications to do with saving a post disappear the next time you save a post or if you navigate away.\r\n\r\n#### Removal:\r\nThe error and warning versions of passive notifications stay until dismissed or the user performs an action that will cause it to disappear. Success notifications fade out after 5 seconds, unless a user hovers over the notification which will reset the 5 second timeout.\r\n\r\n#### Visibility:\r\nPassive notifications are always public as they can only ever appear on the screen which they are created on.\r\n\r\n#### Location:\r\nPassive notifications always appear bottom left.\r\n\r\n## Persistent Notifications\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n![first run](http://puu.sh/8iKdy.png) \r\n![email](http://puu.sh/8iKj2.png) \r\n![upgrade notification](http://puu.sh/8iR1j.png)\r\n\r\n#### Description:\r\nPersistent notifications are long-term notifications usually created by a 'situation' in the server side app, such as this being the first time the app has been run, or their being an update available, or something being mis-configured. \r\n\r\n#### Creation:\r\nPersistent notifications can be created by either the client or server side app. They are made available via an API which stores them in-memory and creates endpoints for adding, removing and fetching all notifications. As notifications are stored in-memory, a server restart would cause some notifications to disappear or reappear.\r\n\r\n#### Removal:\r\nNot all persistent notifications can be dismissed. Some 'nag' notifications such as the update notification will only go away once the situation is resolved - i.e. the upgrade is done so there is no longer a notification needed. At present this would be removed simply by not being re-created in memory on startup. Non-dismissable persistent notifications don't have a close button - the only example of this at present is the upgrade notification which also appears in a different place.\r\n\r\n#### Visibility:\r\nPersistent notifications are private - they can only be seen, added or removed by a logged in user. Effectively, the notifications API requires authentication. Most persistent notifications will be for `owner` or `admin` role users only. With multi-user, it may be that a persistent notification exists for a specific user i.e. informing a user their password should be changed after being created by an admin.

It should also only return items you have permission to see.\r\n\r\n"
1453,'',"/signin discloses user information facilitating blind attacks\nI know this is most certainly done with the best of intentions, to improve the UX of the sign-in process, but reporting back sensitive user information weakens security and facilitates blind attacks against the admin interface.\r\n\r\nEntering incorrect credentials returns: ‘There is no user with that email address.’ which to an attacker equates to ‘Keep trying just the email field at first’.\r\n\r\nA correct email and incorrect password similarly returns: ‘Your password is incorrect’, i.e. ‘You're 50% correct already, keep guessing!’.\r\n\r\nI think it would be preferable if there was no unknown information disclosed, i.e. an attacker isn't told which part they got wrong, and incorrect attempts cleared both fields. This would at least frustrate, and slow, attempts to gain unauthorized access.\r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to propose code to make such change but node.js is way over my head.

1403,'',"check node_modules into git\nGhost is an application and not a module, so we should check node_modules into git.\r\n\r\nWhen distributing modules its advantageous to get the end-user to install dependencies, however this approach is not recommended for applications.\r\n\r\n1. **its unreliable** - if npm is down or slow  this will lead to failed/slow Ghost installs.\r\n2. **its not safe** - specifying exact version for dependencies in the package.json only works for top-level dependencies. Dependencies further down could be updated by npm, which can easily introduce bugs that only show up in production.\r\n\r\nBy checking the  node_modules directory into git (not including dev dependencies) we avoid these problems.\r\n\r\n### Side-Effects \r\n1. There will no need to run **npm install**. \r\n2. Because Ghost uses SQLite which has a static platform dependent binary we have to gitignore **node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding** .\r\n3. Therefore we either get the user to run **npm rebuild sqlite3** or trigger it automatically as part of Ghost's first run. \r\n\r\nFor more background on the subject of checking node_modules into git read this [blog post](http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html) from Mikeal Rogers author of  [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) or watch [Sane Dependency Management](https://vimeo.com/49712055) by Isaac Schlueter author of [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) and maintainer of [nodejs](https://github.com/joyent/node)."

In the model I'm envisioning:\r\n\r\n- The code would live in a shared folder instead of being part of the site files. That folder would be readonly. This would include both the core code and the npm packages. This folder would be managed by Azure as a sort of 'Gallery' code base.\r\n- The data would live in the site files. This would include the DB, themes, and whatever else can be considered 'user state'.\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits of this model:\r\n\r\n1. Site creation is much faster since only the starter data files need to be created.\r\n1. Site cold start time is faster because the shared drive (where all the code lives) is much faster than the site drive. In Azure, the site drive is mounted on blob storage, and it's much slower than a regular drive.\r\n1. User disk space doesn't get eaten up by code files.\r\n1. If a user looks at the site file (e.g. with FTP), there is no chance that they can mistakenly mess up the code.\r\n1. The site can potentially be updated to a newer Ghost version without touching any user files. All it takes is to point the code to a newer version (configurable).\r\n\r\nOne obvious drawback is that the user loses the ability to tweak the core logic, but my take is that only a very small number of users want to do that, and those who do can  always deploy the 'old fashion' way.\r\n\r\n**Question**: how easily can I tweak Ghost to configure where it writes all its data files?

In the cases where it isn't (things which break our uniqueness constraints, or strings which are longer than Ghost permits), we need to message this to the user, and preferably provide a simple UI to fix the issues.\r\n\r\nA successful import should probably also message the user with some details about what has been imported (i.e. successfully imported 321 posts, with 56 tags)."
952,'',"Ghost Import - Validate first.\nI'd really like to see the Ghost Import function given some love.\r\n\r\nThe import tool grabs the data, does some manipulation, and then uses our bookshelf models to add it all to the DB. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, because we're using SQLite, our validation rules are largely ignored because SQLite does not enforce column lengths. So, if someone imports a tag from the WordPress exporter plugin, and that tag happens to have a description > 200 chars, they end up with a tag with a description > 200 chars.\r\nHowever, if you do the same with Ghost running MySQL, you'll get an error message and the import won't work. You can then manually fix the data... but that's pretty uggers.\r\n\r\nWhat I think we need to do is grab the data, run a full suite of validation on it, and then feed back to the user about their data. Is it OK? Are we going to truncate some fields? Etc.\r\n\r\nIf we need to truncate fields to get them into our DB structure, we can then give the user a choice to let us do it, or to manually fix it themselves. This is much more user friendly IMO.\r\n\r\nI also think that splitting the import process into validate, and save, will give us much more flexibility for building plugins which hook into those steps. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [my first stabs at a plugin](https://github.com/ErisDS/Ghost/commit/5a14d35c3b0a4d93dc1f6e46ed5efc811b7db8e4) to see how I modified the current import function to allow plugins to hook in."
951,'','Backbone Implementation 2.0\nSo continuing on from https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/87, I thought it would be useful to have another master bug for the Backbone architecture and implementation in the client. One of the big issues in terms of features is the fact that the admin interface is not yet a single-page app. However, when considering how to fix this, I came across a number of things which I believe need to be addressed in order to implement this cleanly.\r\n\r\nReally these should be separate issues. But as the solutions to each affect the solutions to the others, I thought it made more sense to discuss them together.\r\n\r\n## Issues with the current implementation\r\n\r\n1. No memory management for views (views are never destroyed)\r\n1. Views are doing transitions (animations) manually\r\n1. Routing\r\n  - Sub-sections (e.g. preview post in the mobile view) don\'t have their own backbone routes\r\n  - Handling of links in the mobile view is handled in a global file for all views (`mobile-interactions.js`)\r\n  - Views are changing the route manually ( e.g. https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/client/views/settings.js#L62)\r\n\r\n## Proposed solutions\r\n\r\n### 1. View memory management\r\n\r\n**EITHER** use the [backbone.layoutmanager](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager) plugin. Advantages: Established and stable. Adds a `setView` function to backbone views which will automatically cleanup replaced views. Disadvantages: Contains a lot of functionality we don\'t need.\r\n\r\n**OR** Create a `Ghost.Region` view (extends from `Ghost.View`) with a `setContentView` function or similar, which will automatically cleanup the current "content view", and insert the new one. Advantages: minimal code. Disadvantages: We are duplicating the functionality of an established plugin.\r\n\r\nBased on Ghost\'s current need for view management (fairly minor), I would probably suggest the second option, but the LayoutManager wouldn\'t be a bad option either and could be more future proof.\r\n\r\n### 2. Views are doing transitions (animations) manually\r\nCreate a `Ghost.RegionGroup` view. i.e. an entity with a function which accepts a view, and will automatically render and animate that view, and cleanup the old view. `Ghost.RegionGroup` would depend on `Ghost.Region`.\r\n\r\nExample that I currently use: https://gist.github.com/nicoburns/6772469. This is a complicated example which supports view caching and depends on [renderloop](https://gist.github.com/nicoburns/6772816) (a simple `requestAnimationFrame` wrapper) in order to support JavaScript based animation. It could be simplified a lot if we only needed support for CSS transitions.\r\n\r\n### 3. Routing: (Sub-sections don\'t have their own backbone routes, etc)\r\n\r\nUse the [Backbone.Activities](https://github.com/nicoburns/backbone.activities/tree/wip) plugin. Essentially this would mean adding controllers ("Activities") to our app. This plugin is designed specifically to deal with the issues that arise in responsive backbone apps which we are hitting up against (e.g. that routes need to map to different views for different mobile and desktop layouts). The latest version (0.8) hasn\'t been published (because the docs are currently outdated), but it is very stable (it\'s been tested on multiple apps with tens of thousands of users each), and I could get it released and documented as part of it\'s inclusion in Ghost.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I didn\'t create this plugin, but I have made significant contributions to it. That said, I genuinely believe it is the best solution for responsive Backbone apps. I can write a quick proof of concept if you want to see what Ghost+Activities would look like.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nReally there are two proposed changes here:\r\n\r\n1. The addition of more advanced base views which handle memory management and animation.\r\n1. The addition of controllers "activities" which allow us to abstract views from routes, clearly define separate code paths for the mobile and desktop views, and eliminate routing code from views.\r\n\r\nI think these two changes would really help to clean up our Backbone architecture, and make it a lot easier to add new views in the future.'

Here are my notes aggregated up and made into an epic of sorts.\r\n\r\n**Asynchronous Filter Changes**\r\n\r\n1. [x] `ghost.doFilter` should allow filters to return promises, and be refactored to return a promise itself to match the rest of our code.\r\n2. [x] `ghost.registerAsyncThemeHelper` should allow registering async theme helpers along with the existing sync ones so that helpers who use `ghost.doFilter` will still work.\r\n3. [x] Refactor core theme helpers to be isolated from handlebars so we can test them in isolation.  Basically just move the functions passed to `ghost.registerThemeHelper`  onto something like `coreHelpers.author` and reference it that way.  Then, update the tests to not rely on handlebars rendering synchronously.\r\n4. [x] Pass the server to initPlugins so plugins can register routes and file assets.\r\n\r\n**Misc. Nice to Haves**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Provide a filter for when a post is created/saved/updated; use case is that I wanted to add the default kudos value for each post in my new posts_kudos table but instead had to check on each prePostsRender filter whether the row existed already.\r\n- [ ] Provide some way to get the current post id from the client side code for a plugin.\r\n- [ ] Creating tables and data access through knex is kind of wonky, is there a better way?\r\n- [ ] Make it easier to check if a script is already added (like jquery or underscore) in `ghost_foot` filter.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add to this / modify.  \r\n\r\nI have 1-3 mostly done but will need to rebase on latest, I'll start moving my code from previous PR's into a new branch for this."

Async helpers are rendered differently by handlebars (they put a token in the html and update it once the async is resolved).  The different rendering was breaking all these tests.  Instead of having our unit tests testing more handlebars functionality than our own, I figured this would be a better approach.  I moved each function that was passed to the registerThemeHelper to a value on the coreHelpers object, then just reference it directly from the registerHelpers method.

704,'',"[WIP] Be smarter about how we line up markdown code with the live preview\n*UNFINISHED. There's a case where the ends of the scroll panes don't line up. Submitted for review + comments*\r\n\r\nFixes #481\r\nFixes #535\r\n\r\nCurrently we sync these two panes by working out how many % the user is down the left pane, and extending that ratio to the right side. This is good enough for text, but in long posts, or those with elements like images it can go askew.\r\n\r\nThese changes split both the markdown and the preview into sections (divided by headings). It determines that the user is X percent through section Y, and then applies that same scroll to the other pane.\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\n\r\nRather than interfacing with CodeMirror itself, it scans the HTML that CodeMirror creates. For optimisation reasons, CodeMirror pages content in and out as you scroll (see the viewportMargin option) - meaning that all the content isn't output as HTML at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, there is now a 'shadow' CodeMirror on the page which is a direct copy of the main one, except that it's full-size, invisible and used only for measurements. Regenerating the entire HTML of a CodeMirror can slow down on long documents, so this can't be regenerated with every scroll event. In order to make scrolling silky smooth, the shadow is therefore only regenerated when the user makes a change that affects the height of either pane.\r\n\r\nIt is now bi-directional - you can scroll either side. This feels awesome to use, but means that you can't scroll them independently. If for some reason our calculations screwed up, you wouldn't be able to manually scroll the preview to where it should be. I suggest that we include a little lock icon that fades in when you scroll the preview. Clicking the lock would 'unlock' the preview, so that you can move it independently. Obviously this is a design detail and is up to @JohnONolan\r\n\r\nIt's not throttled/debounced at the moment. Need to test across browsers and devices, and see whether this is needed (expect it is, even if it's with a tiny duration). Otherwise, it could be a good move to use requestAnimationFrame."

Whatever state the post is currently in, there are always two options, one to save as is and one to transition. When the button is set so that the next action would be a transition, the button should be red.\r\n\r\nTo explain in full:\r\n\r\nInitially a post which has not yet been saved should behave the same as a post which has been saved as a draft. The button should be blue, and read **Save Draft**. If you open the menu, **Save Draft** should have a tick next to it (currently it doesn't).\r\n\r\nPressing the button should save the post in its current state of *draft*.\r\n\r\nOpening the menu, and choosing **Publish Now** should put a tick next to **Publish Now** and set the button to say **Publish Now**.

This is reasonably easy to do.. ish..  but has some caveats around post title & slug that we need to work out.\r\n\r\nThe rules at the moment:\r\n\r\n* Post title cannot be blank when saving a post.\r\n* This is because we need the title to generate the slug.\r\n* Once a slug has been generated, it should not be updated except manually (coming in #370)\r\n* This is because changing the permalink without the user knowing is bad - they won't know the URL for their post has changed.\r\n\r\nSo there are problems to deal with - how do we auto-save without a title? Do we just throw a notification to the user saying we can't? Do we save a dummy title/slug?\r\n\r\nWhat about if we auto-save halfway through the user authoring their title? They'll get half a slug...\r\n\r\nShould we relax the rules, and updating a slug up until the post is published, rather than never? What about if a post is unpublished and re-published?\r\n"

482,'',"Migrations are a right royal pain in the arse\nThe migration system is a convoluted & undocumented little corner of hell. Please help me out by discussing how we can improve it.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it works, and it works really quite well. However it seems that it is tricky to understand what is going on, and on top of that getting a migration, fixtures file, import & export setup just to change a tiny property on the DB is... ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI think we need to break this whole problem down into smaller chunks which are solved separately and independently. Then we need to document how this works & put into place tools to make it as easy to do as possible.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brain dump of all the things I know to be true about the current system, along with some ideas on how to improve it. It's a pretty big topic so discussing various areas / suggestions for improvements may need to be done by creating a new issue for that idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migrations\r\n\r\nMigrations are what we call changes to the database schema. However, the schema itself is defined through the magical method of a series of migrations. There is nowhere that the entire schema can be seen and understood, apart from my magical gist: https://gist.github.com/ErisDS/cd0f3d33072410309f37.\r\n\r\nI think Migrations are really two problems. \r\n1. The database schema as it must exist to run the current version of the code.\r\n2. How to get there from older versions of the database.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think that at this stage we are, and need to be, moving much faster than we can with this system in terms of DB changes. So I think it would be a good idea, at some point before the so called 0.3.0 release, to stabilise the schema, create a version of Ghost which upgrades to the stable schema, and then in the next version flatten everything down again & remove the upgrade path. This might mean for example that 0.3.0 is in fact the 'stable schema version' and that anyone (just us & our VIPS atm) on 0.2.0 must upgrade to 0.3.0 before they can upgrade to any 0.4.0 version. 0.4.0 would then become the version we release to KS backers. \r\n\r\nKS backers would get a nice clean migration system. VIPs would have to jump through the 0.3.0 hoop or start a fresh 0.4.0 install.\r\n\r\n## Fixtures\r\n\r\nFixtures are the default data which should exist in a fresh DB at the current version of the code. The data relies on the structure, so they can only be inserted once we have reached the correct structure. \r\n\r\nUpgrading fixtures is a strange problem that I think has been misunderstood. \r\nFixtures should only be for the initial state of the DB, it is expected that the user will overwrite them and therefore we cannot change them later. If we decide we want the 'Fresh Install State' to be different, then we simply change the fixtures.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the moment, we are using 'fixture upgrades' to add new settings which are required to be present, and this is the only thing we are using them for. I think this is indicative of a completely different problem.\r\n\r\nSettings, as they stand, cannot really be added through the API. Additionally, apart from the fixtures, we have no way of describing the settings which are required, what sort of data they should contain and how to validate them.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of problems could be solved by improving the API for settings. Having a definition of required settings, their default value, their validation rules, if they are not overridable (see import) and then having a way to request a setting which, if it is not present, adds it with it's default setting.\r\n\r\n** Update: ** we do also want to move away from using these fixtures as test fixtures and only use them in tests if we are testing the 'Fresh Install State'.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Export\r\n\r\nExport is a JSON dump of EVERYTHING in the DB, so that the DB can be recreated later if something goes wrong. At the moment, the only thing that is different between different versions of export is the list of tables which are present.\r\n\r\nThis information should be accessible by doing some raw SQL queries to list the tables I believe?\r\n\r\nI think we can flatten export down into a single, simple tool by querying the database and asking what's there. We will have a data version stamp which we can put in the meta data, and I recommend also adding the Ghost version number, just in case.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Import\r\n\r\nImport is a slightly different ball game to export. Bringing data in is a bit harder as we need to know what version of data we have, and what version of database schema we have and how to get from one to the other.\r\n\r\nWe also have to know a bit more about the structure / type of the data we are importing. At the moment there are a set of rules which are something like: \r\n \r\n* if it is a post, strip the primary key and insert (effectively appending posts to the current ones)\r\n* if it is a user, overwrite the current user. - This ensures that there is only ever 1 user of id 1. It will break if there is no current user... but then as import is run through the interface you have to have logged in to do it.\r\n* if it is a setting, update the setting's value if the key is present, otherwise insert it, unless it is the currentVersion setting, in which case do nothing as this setting must not be overridden.\r\n* for anything else, strip the primary key and insert it\r\n\r\nThese rules are reasonably sane, and the way the import is written there is very little reason to have any more than 1 importer. In the case that this changes, we could expand the import system, but for now I believe it can be flattened?\r\n\r\nFor example, if we finally update the users to work for multi-user, we can change the importer at the same time, and any user importing TO that version will get the correct functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe user can only ever be on a single version of the codebase, which has a single version of the database schema. Thus all each version needs is to be able to handle getting *TO* that version from any earlier version. \r\n\r\nThe code we have achieves this, but I think it's a little bit complex and I have the feeling it's a bit backwards. It seems to be focused around pushing from nothing towards a new version, when in fact we should be pulling users into the right version from wherever they are. It's a subtle difference that I'm not articulating very well.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

Whoever takes this on needs to take care not to introduce a bunch of regressions, this probably means writing quite a few additional unit tests before tackling it.\r\n\r\nThere is some discussion of this in #52 \r\n\r\nMy original intention was that ghost.js would provide the API used by themes and plugins to interact with Ghost - registering helpers and filters and such like. However, it quickly spiraled into a dumping ground (my fault) and now it's the place where several *things* live. It's also a bloody ugly singleton.\r\n\r\nThe main *things* that ghost.js now seems to be made up of are:\r\n\r\n- App initialisation - split between here, line #142 of index.js, and various other modules (helpers/filters). \r\n- An API for themes/plugins\r\n- An internal API for state / properties\r\n\r\nThese things should be much more clearly separated, perhaps in separate files/modules. \r\n\r\nThe app initialisation needs to be more organised. Perhaps some of it should be middleware? The rest of it should be come much more managed, such that we have a single init function on which we wait in index.js if we need to. Additionally there is the ghost.loaded promise in index.js that I don't think we need at all.\r\n\r\nThe API for themes/plugins should be disentangled such that it can be offered up to themes/plugins without them getting all the other crud / access to things they really shouldn't have.\r\n\r\nThe internal API / state should be cleanly managed.

Clicking the icon should hide the image and show the image upload form from the editor preview pane http://cl.ly/NxpQ\r\n- [x] If there is no image, the image upload form should be present\r\n- [x] The wrapper should automatically configure our upload location, including handling /year/month folders and limiting uploads to any file with a .gif, .jpg or .png extension.\r\n- [x] By default the wrapper should append a progress element and update it as designed for the editor. There should be an option to turn this off.\r\n- [x] The wrapper should also trigger focused, start, progress, success and failure events for other things to listen to as these will likely be handled differently in different places.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Implemention notes: **\r\n\r\nThe wrapper should be a jQuery plugin living in `client/assets/lib` that operates on an element which contains at least a single file input and binds this to the BlueImp uploader. The element may also contain an image and an element to use as a dropzone if configured. In the case that the element contains only a file input, the plugin should manage the addition of elements to display the image and dropzone as necessary. The plugin should look for elements with a specific class name to use as the image and the dropzone, it should be possible to configure the plugin to look for alternative elements.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the plugin will not work correctly if placed inside a label element, and therefore the markup on the settings page needs to change.

246,'ErisDS',"Theme API: Helpers, naming and API friendliness\nAs it stands there are a few inconsistencies and oddities with the set of core helpers that we have on offer:\r\n\r\n- [x] 1. Some helpers require double taches `{{` and some require triple `{{{` - triple taches are used to indicate that the content should not be escaped, but for helpers which always render HTML, the non-escaping should be managed with handlebars.SafeString()\r\n- [x] 2. The nav and pagination helpers require that an object be passed to them, it is always the same object with the same name. As handlebars gets given the context, it should always have reference to the object and not require it to be passed. However, the current implementation obscures the context and prevents this.\r\n- [ ] 3. There should be a common way to override these defaults (i.e. a way to turn off using SafeString and to pass in a different object for the helper to use)\r\n- [x] 4. Handlebars has support for async helpers, but we don't use it.\r\n- [x] 5. We've got the concept of helpers which compile and use a template, which is awesome, but the code is being duplicated - I'd like to make this available as a core feature where we can simply register a name, a function and a template name and everything else is done\r\n- [x] 6. Themes should be able to override the template, and our core template helper should pick that up and use it instead in #294\r\n- [x] 7. It might be nice to make template helpers also be block helpers - or is having 2 ways to override a little nuts? Pagination example for this is below.\r\n- [x] 8. {{content_html}} is horrible... `content` should be come `content_raw` and `content_html` should become `content`  - **big breaking change alert!**  - to be done in 0.2: #253\r\n- [x] 9. We should introduce a {{content}} helper, which will override the content property (the html) and allow us to give the user options like length, or num words, or some such. #254\r\n- [x] 10. Would be good to start keeping a list of, and raising issues for, other helpers we need such as post link, author, tags, etc\r\n- [x] 11. Helpers need more test coverage - they're one thing we're exposing to users, so it would be good to ensure we can't break them or change their functionality without knowing about it.\r\n- [x] 12. `single.hbs` - should be `post.hbs` (Ghost + Casper)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample for 7. is on it's way\r\n\r\nThis is a big-arse issue I'm using for keeping track of Theme API related stuff, expect to see sub issues in the near future.\r\n\r\n"

Do they simply mirror the  local Ghost image directory?*\r\n\r\n## Featured Images\r\n\r\nWhat if the concept of a "featured image" is simply the first image that appears (completely optionally) in any post.\r\n\r\nTurning the concept of the WordPress featured image on its head - rather than the user being forced to create an entity defined as a thumbnail, the theme checks for something which it can use as a featured image.\r\n\r\nGhost scans a post to see if an image is available to use as a featured image - when it finds one, it uses it. If no image exists in the post which meets the required dimensions - a featured image is not assigned.\r\n\r\n## Markdown\r\n\r\nWe are extending markdown to produce some new functionality with the Ghost editor. By typing the following syntax:\r\n\r\n`!image[alt text](source)`\r\n\r\nan image uploader is generated in the content preview pane. Once an image is uploaded via this upload form, the markdown is then populated with the appropriate data.

An image is a block of media equivalent to a paragraph.

The `Ghost.init()` should be modified to also call `permissions.init()`.  Any time permissions are updated/modified, we should call `permissions.refresh()`; I think we can do this with a global saving handler on the Permission model, but I\'m not sure.\r\n- Any code that needs to check permissions will `require(\'./core/shared/permissions\')`\r\n- Calling `permissions.canThis(userModelOrId).edit.post()` returns a promise that will resolve or reject based on whether the user can do the action.\r\n- Underneath the covers the `canThis(...)` call is loading the users "effectivePermissions" meaning all the users permissions and any roles it has\' permissions.\r\n\r\n'

I felt that if we weren\'t using an official lib (no license, attribution, etc) but instead adding conventions of our own, we should keep these things inside the ghost js files for now as opposed to `lib`. I\'d be happy to discuss with @ricardobeat - but the general premise is that I think it simpler if you don\'t have to name each subview, because if you\'re doing things correctly in backbone (listening & rendering on events, etc.) you normally don\'t need to refer to them by name in the parent, and when you do need that, you can just:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthis.childItem = this.addSubview(new ChildItem()).render();\r\nthis.append(this.childItem.el);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI\'d be alright with going back to requiring a name for each subview if there\'s a strong argument.'

52,'','Opening some discussion on the app structure\nSo these are just some ramblings I have about development style/structure for the frontend and backend, along with sort of a few few minutes of playing around with a few files... disregard most of the code, except maybe [this file] (https://github.com/tgriesser/Ghost/blob/d7d7f65512482a4bab94ec4539f0783554b7060f/core/ghost.js), it\'s not intended to be merged (nothing works most likely, I don\'t actually have ghost running while doing this stuff). This is more of just a sandbox to show some ideas/get some discussion going around with code style/app structure.\r\n\r\nSo coding for the browser and node are sort of two different environments, and while they\'re both javascript, they sort of have two different purposes...\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with the actual server side logic (not libs/modules that are shared between the two), I find it a bit clearer to embrace the ability to declare things as/where necessary, using the `exports` object (where it makes sense - maybe use `module.exports` if you\'re exporting a constructor)... but if we\'re going to keep the app as a singleton for now, we might as well just use the containing scope of the main file as the module - `exports` is cached on subsequent requires - as opposed to having the `if (!instance)` check (forced singletons usually feel like a bit of an anti-pattern anyway)... Then we can easily add the ability to create multiple instance easily later if need be...\r\n\r\nThese are sort of the general style guide for node apps:\r\n\r\nhttps://npmjs.org/doc/coding-style.html\r\nhttp://nodeguide.com/style.html\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know if it was worth considering following some of these for the server and then using whatever else we\'d like for the client... part of my reasoning being that since the node aspect of the project is heavily promoted, it might make sense to follow patterns familiar to node developers to encourage contribution.\r\n\r\nI also find that the node guidelines tends to make the app structure simpler... the module patterns makes a lot of sense when you explicitly want to prevent people from fiddling with the innards of the application - but if we\'re making this open, we\'d probably want to make it easier to do that, correct? Or maybe not, but it\'d be good to figure out what we should/shouldn\'t make easy to fiddle with.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, `"use strict"` is overrated - it\'s more of something you should be doing when writing good javascript, then needing to require a top level wrapper, and as far as I\'ve been able to find researching it, adding the actual `"use strict"` declaration doesn\'t offer any performance gains. I\'m also sure it\'s pretty simple too hook into whatever test suite we\'re going to be using to actually validate against strict mode when running unit tests on the backend.\r\n\r\nI also wasn\'t sure if it made sense to try to abstract everything from the beginning (i.e. with the dataprovider module)... that seems like it\'d be what the ORM layer would be for for, and it might make sense to keep things really simple to start out with (simple routes handlers, simple models, etc) and then build up the abstractions once we see what the patterns are (controllers, dataprovider instances).\r\n\r\nAnd finally - having done it a few times both ways, I think that it\'s easier to keep the filesystem grouped by type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/core\r\n  /controllers\r\n    - admin.js\r\n    - frontend.js\r\n  /model\r\n    - data.js\r\n  /views\r\n    /admin\r\n       - admin_file.hbs\r\n    /frontend\r\n       - frontend_file.hbs \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt just seems easier to group conceptually, since then you don\'t need to think about which pieces of the data model only apply to the backend, or frontend, or shared... and the assets, etc. are going to be likely concatenated and moved around anyway, so those could live outside of the folders.\r\n\r\nJust some ideas (and a few minutes of playing around with the code) I thought I\'d put out there for some discussion... I\'m probably going to keep fiddling with different pieces of the app to see what I come up with.\r\n\r\nSorry this was sort of a lot, I\'m just looking start some discussion and get any feedback... and I won\'t take it personally if everyone disagrees with all of this :)'

4498,'',"[Discussion] JSON API: Include many-to-many relation ids by default?\nThis is a discussion split out from https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/4232\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) standard that we *try* to follow has a lot of opinions about how to include linked objects in a response. The standard is still in development and keeps changing, so we only use it as a guide.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that we tried to do was to include the IDs of all related objects by default and then expand linked objects out into the full object if the object is named as an `include`.\r\n\r\nSo for example, the post object returns this by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  id: 1,\r\n  title: 'Welcome to Ghost',\r\n  author: 1,\r\n  ...,\r\n  tags: [3, 5, 12]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you add `?include=tags` the tags will be expanded out like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  id: 1,\r\n  title: 'Welcome to Ghost',\r\n  author: { },\r\n  ...,\r\n  tags: [{\r\n     id: 3, \r\n     name: 'Getting Started',\r\n     ...\r\n  },{\r\n    ...\r\n },\r\n...\r\n]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems with this. First, the JSON-API standard says these linked items should be inside a links object like:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n  id: 1,\r\n  ...,\r\n  links: {\r\n     author: 1,\r\n     tags: [3, 5, 12]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't fit how we want to use the API - with the ability to access easily guessable keys like `post.author` or `post.tags`. We'd have to wrangle bookshelf to treat all foreign keys and other relations differently in order to achieve it and the only benefit would be following the standard.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the requirement to always include the IDs of many-to-many relations means (at the moment in the post model) telling bookshelf to do loads of extra joins, just to pull out the id and ignore everything else.\r\n\r\nFurther, although we aimed to do this, it has only been done for tags and fields on the post model and not implemented anywhere else, because the implementation of this is manual. There are loads of places where it is missing:\r\n\r\n- tags should return posts\r\n- user should return ids of roles, permissions and posts\r\n- roles, permissions should return users, apps, etc\r\n- the list goes on\r\n\r\nSo the question is, does it really make sense to go back through the API and add this everywhere it is missing, doing lots of additional queries we don't really need when the only benefit is that one-to-many and many-to-many relations are consistent with each other as we are not actually matching the JSON API 'linked' object standard anyway?\r\n\r\nOr, does it make more sense to drop this feature temporarily from where it has been implemented for simplicity and efficiency?\r\n\r\nThe long term plan (if we really wanted to add it back) could be to build this as a bookshelf plugin or similar. The plugin would automatically pull JUST ids for all many-to-many relations from the join table, rather than joining again to the other resource table and fetching all the data.\r\n\r\nI.e. you can get the list of all IDs for tags related posts from the `posts_tags` table, without having to also look at the tags table. This would be more efficient and it would be fully automatic.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR I propose that many-to-many related resources are not included in the response for a resource at all unless explicitly required by `?include=`**"

Pretty much all node libraries for image processing have imagemagick as a dependency - and that is not a viable solution for Ghost due it it being a c++ program that\'s ridiculously hard to install. This leaves us with a few alternative options:\r\n\r\n1. **Client** - Do the processing on the client side\r\n2. **PureJS** - Find a pure JS module for image processing\r\n3. **Compiler** - Compile imagemagick using something like emscripten\r\n4. **node-pre-gyp** - Create or change an existing node module which wraps imagemagick to use `node-pre-gyp` which is the same thing we use to install sqlite3\r\n5. **API** - Use a 3rd party API for image processing\r\n6. **Other** Some other solution we haven\'t thought of yet.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these solutions have been discussed or covered in the comments on #1688 and #1734, so they are worth a read ;)\r\n\r\n## What we know so far\r\n\r\n1. **Client** - it may be possible to do simple cropping or resizing using the canvas element and/or File API, but this won\'t work for any sort of regeneration of sizes, so it won\'t present a full solution. JavaScript-Load-Image (mentioned [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1688#issuecomment-30852861) is probably worth looking into though).\r\n\r\n2. **PureJS** - [lwip](https://github.com/EyalAr/lwip) is the only one I knew of, mentioned in #1734, but it turns out even that is actually largely written in C/C++! Is there really not a single PureJS one out there?! This needs investigating.\r\n\r\n3. **Compilers** - there was quite an extensive discussion on modules that we could potentially compile into JS and how on https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1688#issuecomment-30776652, this is worth further investigation as we might be a few small steps from a solution here.\r\n\r\n4. **node-pre-gyp** - if we could identify one of the imagemagick wrapper projects which has the features we need and might be active and willing to accept a PR this might be a viable option. node-pre-gyp has taken pretty much all of the pain out of sqlite3 installs. Still, as this is nowhere near as important a dependency as sqlite, I wonder if it will resolve the issue quite enough to be worth the problems some people will still have.\r\n\r\n5. **API** - there are a few that have been mentioned although I can\'t find the references now. Worth investigating, but this is likely to require keys and other complexities.\r\n\r\n5. **Other** - anyone got any bright ideas?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn summary, there\'s quite a bit of research and investigation to be done to come up with a couple of potential solutions for image processing in Ghost, and weigh up their pros and cons. I don\'t think there is going to be an obvious winner, but we need to gather together a clear picture of what\'s available to us so we can make a decision. The key thing is that we only\\* need crop, rotate, resize, exif modification & some optimisation tools - we aren\'t trying to detect faces or anything!\r\n\r\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to jump in on this, with any solution they can come up with - I\'m not looking for one person to do all the research but rather for people to volunteer their suggestions.\r\n\r\n\\* I know I know *only*... haha\r\n'

Rather than trying to generate the post's URL from the permalink setting whenever we need it (in the frontend controller, or in the admin client) we should do this inside the model layer, and return it as a computed property along with the post object.\r\n\r\nBookshelf provides us with a mechanism to do this - the `toJSON` method in the post model, which is already used to make sure we return an `author` property rather than `author_id`.\r\n\r\nThe code for generating a URL from a permalink should probably still live in `config/url.js` although the methods in url.js may need to be changed around to make the right ones available to the post model. As a result of this issue, the `urlFor` method should be updated to use the new `url` property, rather than calling `urlPathForPost`, but it is not expected that the property be used elsewhere or that any of the other issues be resolved.\r\n\r\nThis issue should require updates to our tests.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I'm slightly in two minds about whether this field ought to be called `url` or `permalink`. I'm leaning toward `url` because then it matches up with the `url` helper and we can reserve `permalink` for if we implement some other concept of a `permalink` (many platforms use a url with an ID, and having something like that could help us to implement historical redirects when permalink structures change).

It\'s also similar to doing something like `{{date published_at format="dd mm YY"}}` where there can be a parameter and an attribute, and just like the date helper defaults to published_at, the fetch helper can default to posts.\r\n\r\nThe third one makes everything consistent, but as soon as you start using named parameters you need to do something like `id="12"` or `slug="welcome-to-ghost"` if you want to specify an id, or a slug etc to fetch a specific resource.\r\n\r\nThoughts on a postcard please!

This will happen if `config.url` includes `https`.\r\nNext, req.secure must be false. This can happen when the blog is set up behind a reverse-proxy. Without a few configuration lines, express does not trust that the connection is secure. See fix 2 below.\r\n\r\nThen you get to this line:\r\n```\r\n            redirectUrl = url.parse(config.urlSSL || config.url);\r\n            return res.redirect(301, url.format({\r\n                protocol: 'https:',\r\n                hostname: redirectUrl.hostname,\r\n                port: redirectUrl.port,\r\n                pathname: req.path, //<- PROBLEM\r\n                query: req.query\r\n            }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the site is mounted on a subdirectory, like `/blog`, the `req.path` for `/blog/ghost` is just `/ghost`.\r\nTo fix this, just substitute `req.path` for `redirectUrl.path`.\r\n\r\n**HOWEVER**, this causes another problem if the nginx misconfiguration still exists. In that case, the request will end up back in this handler, and the whole thing will loop again.\r\n\r\n# The Solution\r\n## Fix 1\r\nSet the `pathname` correctly on the problem line (pull request coming soon)\r\n## Fix 2\r\nThe parent app of the Ghost Instance **must** trust the reverse proxy, so set `app.set( 'trust proxy', 'localhost' )`. (or the IP of the reverse proxy)\r\nOnce that is done, make sure the proxy is setting `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` when the request is passed to the NodeJS app."

4396,'',"[Discussion] Improving our development process\nLately, we've been trying out new things with our development process in order to get a bit more fluid (agile) and move towards releasing little-and-often instead of dropping great big releases every few months. Some of this has gone really well (we're releasing more stuff faster) and some of it hasn't necessarily (I don't feel like the process is particularly clear). So I'd like to get some feedback on ideas on how to get better at doing what we do.\r\n\r\nI have the following goals:\r\n\r\n- Make sure the what and why of our short and mid-terms priorities are clear\r\n- Ensure that our current contributors are happy that our processes are working well\r\n- Encourage more new contributors to get stuck in & make it easier for them to do so\r\n\r\nTo aid the conversation, below is a little bit of an overview of the way we work:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- We have a public meeting in the #ghost IRC channel on Tuesday every week at 5:30pm London time, to discuss progress and what's next.\r\n- Our **public roadmap** is on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap) and is 100% feature-focused. The `Backlog` column is a list of things we want to do one day (for v1.0), `Next` is for things that are ready to work on and we want to get into a release, and `In Progress` is for things which are actively being worked on.\r\n- We have 3 [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/milestones) we use as **issue backlogs**: `Current` which contains the 'top 10' priority items for the next release, `Next` which contains everything else that is ready to be picked up and worked on, and `Future` which contains other tasks we're tracking but that are blocked on something else.\r\n- The roadmap and backlog are curated by those with admin access (Ghost Foundation + Core Team members), but mostly by @JohnONolan and me, based on a mix of user demand and what is technically possible / ready to implement.\r\n- We don't *really* have a long term plan of when things should ship, just a general idea of what we need to do to get to 1.0\r\n- We have a **blocker** tag which we use when we start thinking about doing a release for anything preventing a release going out, or anything super-duper high priority to get fixed.\r\n- We have a **beginner** tag to mark issues suitable for developers who are new to the Ghost codebase\r\n- We have a **help wanted** tag to mark issues we'd love someone to come and get involved with\r\n- We **release** whenever we feel ready, and I usually give an indication of when that will be in the dev meeting & blog post (currently I'm still the only person able to do this).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome ideas to get us started:\r\n\r\n- Overhaul the contribution guidelines with a TL;DR, more links to wiki pages on process and how to get started (I've started this a couple of times and not been happy with the results.)\r\n- Overhaul the Ghost wiki to focus (even) more on being a contributors/developers manual\r\n- Figure out the best approach to documenting the code base and push forward with making it a reality\r\n- Start publishing job spec type listings on Ghost.org advertising for contributors to certain areas (like OAuth, Search, i18n)\r\n- Revitalise the wiki Roadmap page to have more detail about high priority items which are not features so are not on the public roadmap, but are blocking features (like permission migrations) \r\n- Have a 'Road to 0.6' type write up either in the roadmap or in an Epic issue itemising the bare minimum features / refactors / bugs / etc we'd like to get in before we're ready to call Ghost 0.6, their dependencies and any other relevant info\r\n- Do a big write up of the long term plan for Ghost 1.0\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm very, VERY interested to hear feedback and new ideas. This is going to be pretty much all personal opinion, so in the interest of keeping the discussion positive, productive and awesome, please try to qualify your ideas and concerns by telling us about your workflow and how the processes do or don't fit in.

4368,'ErisDS',"Drop CodeMirror from the Editor\nWith reference to the [Split Screen Editor Epic (#1294)](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1294)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThe Ghost editor undeniably needs some :heart:. No matter how you consider what the editor might look like in the future, there is one underlying problem - to ship improvements like spellcheck, we need to build a completely custom editor, that's an enormous undertaking, and it would detract from all the other features we want to ship :-1:.\r\n\r\nThat is, unless we drop formatting/syntax highlighting from the left side of the editor :boom: \r\n\r\n**yep**... I'm talking about dropping CodeMirror in favour of a plain textarea.\r\n\r\nCodeMirror currently has two main jobs: 1) it formats/syntax highlights the markdown and 2) provides an API for interacting with the entered text. However, what it does under the bonnet is generate a completely custom representation of the document which is neither markdown or HTML. This breaks the [browser spellcheck](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1240), doesn't work reliably [on mobile/touch](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/960) (which meant we had to remove it from mobile/touch devices), and the way it interprets markdown is quite different to our HTML conversion, which causes [weird](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/959) [bugs](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1909) and adds complexity.\r\n\r\nIf we strip out CodeMirror, we will lose formatting, but what we get instead will be an editor with working **spellcheck**, working **mobile uploads** and significantly reduced complexity: because we only have two document representations - markdown and HTML, and we are in control of them both. This means we can focus on making the conversion between them better (i.e. adding advanced markdown features).\r\n\r\nIn the future, we'll be able to bring back formatting if we want it using contenteditable, but in the meantime we can more easily focus on the features we want to bring to the editor, the markdown we want to support, and creating our own way of modelling documents - because the editor is so significantly less complicated.\r\n\r\nI've been working on a prototype testing out how to interact with selections in the textarea to make sure that image uploads will still work (on ALL devices) etc and to me this feels like taking back control, and I'm REALLY, _**ridiculously**_ excited about it."

4364,'',"Auto-indent of partials causes problems with rendering code blocks in blog posts\nThere is an ongoing discussion about this on the [handlebars repo](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/858#issuecomment-61109359). It was originally discovered as a sort-of-bug-in-Ghost via a weird issue [on the forum](https://ghost.org/forum/using-ghost/16929-indentations-syntax-highlightling/) and applies to [themes which use a partial to output content](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/ghost-themes/blob/phantom/post.hbs#L15). I'm raising it here as a way to keep track of it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEssentially, in Handlebars 2.0.0, any partial which is indented is now rendered with that indent applied to the beginning of every line output by the partial. So if I have a partial like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<section>\r\n{{content}}\r\n</section>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I output it in my `post.hbs` like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    {{> my-partial}}\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen every line of the partial, including every line output by `{{content}}` will have 4 spaces applied at the beginning, just like the `    {{> my-partial}}` line has.\r\n\r\nThis sort of makes sense - it makes for nicely aligned source code, but it also fudges with anything in the partial which is whitespace-sensitive, like a `<pre>` or a `<textarea>`. Essentially, if you have a nicely formatted code block in your blog content, when it gets rendered to the page, all the lines of code will weirdly have 4 extra spaces at the start.\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple enough - don't use a partial, or don't indent your partial, but this behaviour is very hard to predict in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the [handlebars repo](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/858#issuecomment-61109359) might lead to a compiler flag we can use to disable this. Alternatively we could downgrade back to handlebars 1.3.0 for rendering themes. If we do neither of these, then we have to be very careful to document this behaviour."

The structure of the permalink is set in the database, and valid structures are defined in #1631. \r\n\r\nThe frontend controller needs to take the permalink setting, the URL from which it is being called and validate that all parts of the URL strictly match / are valid according to the permalink.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is validation for the date, and after #3858 is completed, there should also be validation for the author, but this needs to be refactored and added to, to validate that all items in the URL are complete and correct.\r\n\r\nTake for example, the slightly weird, but perfectly valid permalink structure of `/blog/:slug/:author/:year/:id/`. \r\n\r\nThe frontend controller should split the provided URL into 5 parts and then:\r\n\r\n* Look up a post which matches both the provided `slug` AND `id` \r\n* Check that the first part (a string `blog`) is exactly 'blog'\r\n* Check that the third part matches the slug of the post's author\r\n* Check that the fouth part matches the year in the post's `published_at` field\r\n\r\nIf any of these steps fail, a 404 should be returned.\r\n\r\nThe point of this issue is to refactor this validation step so that the code is clear and easily readable, to add validation so that string sections are definitely checked, and to add thorough unit tests for the code.\r\n\r\nIt probably makes sense to do the lookup in the `frontend.single` controller, but split the checks out into a new method in `server/config/url.js` which verifies that a given URL is a valid URL for a given post. So very similar to the [`urlPathForPost`](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/4067bfe4c15ace3e6d8bc074c98ed1be5437eb90/core/server/config/url.js#L58) function, `checkUrlPathForPost` would also take the post data and the url provided and return whether or not it is valid.\r\n\r\nThis would drastically improve the code quality in [`server/controllers/frontend.js`](https://codeclimate.com/repos/53abbc5e695680579600cbb2/core/server/controllers/frontend.js)\r\n\r\n"

4319,'ErisDS',"Theme feature detection\nThe Ghost theme API moves pretty fast, pretty much every release includes some sort of change, and we need a way to make it clearer what version of Ghost a theme will work with.\r\n\r\nRather than using a version number, and depending on theme developers to provide an accurate Ghost version number which their theme works with, let's do this in a really smart way, and actually detect which features a Ghost theme is or isn't using.\r\n\r\nSome features being missing constitutes an outright error (like no `{{asset}}` helper) some might represent a warning (use of the deprecated features) and some might be a positive (like themes already supporting `{{image}}`). Therefore I think we can do something really interesting with a simple set of tools to detect use of helpers and other things, a set of rules and converting the information into a standardised output that we can generate and display for any theme.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to do this as an independent npm module, which can be a dependency in Ghost (used to check a theme when it is activated), but also offered as a web UI where theme developers can check their theme (a bit like http://package-json-validator.com/), and then it can also be included in or used by other sites and projects.\r\n\r\nMy goal here is to make information about theme features, compatibility and quality far more transparent, so that we can give our users a far better experience when using 3rd party themes.\r\n\r\nI've been working on this just a little bit, and once I've finished laying the groundwork I'll link this to the repo and start opening issues there to improve it, so people can get stuck in improving it if they're interested.\r\n\r\nFeatures to be detected:\r\n\r\n* details coming soon\r\n"

4262,'',"API: Next and Previous post\nMany moons ago, #529 was raised to describe a future in which theme developers were able to access information about the next and previous post, according to the chronological order which posts are published on the blog.\r\n\r\nBack then, bookshelf didn't support subqueries, we didn't have a clear plan for the API, and we didn't have any idea about having a query helper. All of these things combined to make this issue quite tricky to solve.\r\n\r\nThe solution that was put forward was an always-on addition to the API which meant making 2 extra queries for every post page. This seemed like unnecessary overhead for the `GET /posts/` request for a feature that wouldn't be used by everyone. Not having performance tests made it riskier.\r\n\r\nNow that we have a clearer idea of what our API is supposed to look like (in short, JSON API but with inline objects rather than `linked`), it is much easier to design clean solutions to problems like this one. The proposal for adding next & previous support to the API is to update the posts endpoint to accept `next` and `previous` as `includes` E.g.\r\n\r\nGET `/posts/?include=next,previous`\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to add one or both of these options, and get the corresponding post returned in the response in the following format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    posts: [{\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        title: 'Something here',\r\n        ...\r\n        next: { \r\n             id: 6,\r\n             title: 'Another post thing',\r\n             ...\r\n        }\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementing this at the model level is going to require some fancy bookshelf-ery. May be worth using the subquery support here. Performance testing would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- `next` is the post published after the current post, so should be more recent\r\n- `previous` is the post published before\r\n- If the `next` or `previous` posts are requested but don't exist because we are at one end of the list or another, the key should be included, but the body should be null.\r\n- To make the API consistent, we should always return `next` and `previous` keys with the id of the post, such that adding them to `include` causes the whole object to be included, rather than the keys to magically appear. This definitely needs perf tests and will likely be a separate issue.\r\n- This is just an API addition and won't make this feature available to themes"

A request to public API endpoints from a JavaScript application needs to comply with the following rules. Public endpoints in this context are endpoints that don't need an authorized user for being accessed.\r\n\r\n- The request needs to be sent with a valid client_id. The client_id is added as URL parameter or sent with the request body. This mechanism is already used for the Ghost admin and implemented in [auth-strategies.js](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/core/server/middleware/auth-strategies.js#L16).\r\n- Every request from a JavaScript application has to be sent using AJAX. This can be detected  by checking the `X-Requested-With` header or simply using the `req.xhr` value that express.js adds to every request.\r\n- The originating domain has to be valid for a request to the API. When a new client side application is added to Ghost the trusted domains have to be added and every request for a certain client_id is checked against those values. The calling host can be found out by reading the host header (`var host = req.get('host');`).\r\n\r\nHeader values are not always trustable but checking them should be enough to deny random attempts to access the API."

4004,'',"OAuth continued - Open the JSON API via OAuth\n# Clients\r\n\r\nIn order to make the Ghost API accessible publicly we need to extend our support for OAuth and add different endpoints to the API for adding clients and dealing with authorization requests.\r\n\r\nGhost is going to support two different kinds of clients, **Web and Installed Applications** and JavaScript-centric applications that run on the **Client Side**. There is no full public access for everyone as we need to make sure that the operator of a blog is still able to deny access to clients that are not approved.\r\n\r\n## Web and Installed Applications\r\n\r\nThe Ghost API supports web, desktop and mobile application.\r\n\r\n### Public access to API endpoints:\r\n\r\nWeb and installed applications are allowed to access all API endpoints that don't require authentication by using the client authentication as described in RFC 6749 - 2.3. Client credentials (`client_id` and `client_secret`) have to be transmitted with each request to one of the public endpoints to get access.  Desktop and mobile applications are distributed to individual machines, and it is assumed that these clients cannot keep secrets. Therefore no special access rights are granted when using client credentials to access the API for now. \r\n\r\n### Authenticated access to API endpoints:\r\n\r\nIf an application wants to access endpoints that requires authentication it has to use the `Authorization Code Grant` method described in RFC 6749 - 4.1. This grant type requires the user to be redirected to your Ghost blog, where the user authenticates the application. After successful authentication a short lived, single-use code is returned which allows the application to acquire access and refresh token on behalf of the user.\r\n\r\n## Client Side\r\n\r\nThe Ghost API supports JavaScript-centric applications. These applications are allowed to access the Ghost API but are treated differently since they typically can't keep a secret.\r\n\r\n### Public access to API endpoints:\r\n\r\nRequests to public endpoints must send a valid client id of a registered client. This is similar to what Google does for Google Maps.\r\n\r\nClient side applications are allowed to a access endpoints that don't require authentication if the request comes from a known domain via ajax request (`localhost` is allowed during development) and contains the client id of a registered application. Checking header values does not guarantee that the client is genuine, but it should prevent random attempts to access the API and allow to revoke access from unwanted clients.\r\n\r\n### Authenticated access to API endpoints:\r\n\r\nIf a client side application wants to access an endpoint that requires authentication it has to use the `Implicit Grant` method described in RFC 6749 - 4.2. This grant type take into account that the application can't keep a secret and therefore provides no code to acquire access and refresh tokens but returns an access token immediately. Refresh tokens are not available and a user has to authorize the app again whenever the access token expires.\r\n\r\nTo get an access token the application has to redirect the user to a Ghost server where the user authorizes the application. After successful authorization an access token is returned which grants access to the API for a limited time.\r\n\r\n# Scopes\r\n\r\nOAuth allows to optionally specify the scope of a client. Ghost provides the concept of app permissions and I would suggest to use the same permission model for clients as well. Permissions have to be specified when the app is registered and should be presented to the user when an user authorizes an app to access the API.\r\n\r\n# Authorize endpoint\r\n\r\nThe `Authorization Code Grant` and `Implicit Grant` flows require the user to be redirected to an authorization page that runs on the Ghost server. We have to determine where we could add this page to our ember admin and how to redirect the user back to the inquiring client.\r\n\r\n# Register a client\r\n\r\nAdding a client is done by an authorized user that manually sets up the allowed application and then copies the client credentials to the appropriate places in the client. Examples for such registration pages can be found on the developer pages of Twitter, Facebook or GitHub.\r\n\r\nAdding the client manually is easily doable for services that only run on one domain. In our case a client application would have to be registered for every single installation of Ghost. This would require a user to add the application to Ghost before s/he could use a 3rd party client. A draft for registering clients automatically (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg-20) has been published but isn't a specification yet.\r\n\r\nBased on the draft for registering clients automatically I would propose to allow the registration of new clients during the authorization process. That means that a 3rd party client can send registration information along with the authorization information if the client is used with a service for the first time. The user is then asked to add the new client, if he approves the authorization process continues.\r\n\r\n# Default clients\r\n\r\nAs Ghost admin and Ghost frontend also need to access the API and authenticate using oAuth there will be two default clients that are available on every Ghost blog. `client_id` and `client_secret` are generated randomly for every blog.\r\n\r\n- Ghost admin (exists but needs update)\r\n- Ghost frontend (new)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is an overview issue for implementing further OAuth features.

3961,'',"Change the `{{url}}`helper to be synchronous\nI'm not 100% on what the options for doing this are, but I *think* we can achieve it if we're a bit clever.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why the helper is async, is due to the need to fetch the permalink setting. However, settings are cached meaning that this is normally a synchronous operation anyway. Further still, there should be no need to do this more than one per render of a view, so I'm thinking we could perhaps cache the setting either against the helpers or against express with `app.set` as part of the setup middleware.\r\n\r\nIt'd probably be good to do something like this with settings & config that affect rendering: url, permalink, activeTheme, postsPerPage etc. URL can only change on a server restart, and the others require settings to be changed, so we could refresh the caches for these object either based on events (something we've talked about elsewhere) or only change the values if they're not set, or if the current request is an admin request.\r\n\r\nJust throwing around some thoughts, but the goal remains simple: make `{{url}}` a normal helper, rather than an async helper. \r\n\r\nRemoving the need for async helpers at all is a secondary goal as they're unlikely to ever be supported properly."

3850,'',"API response support for warnings as well as errors\nThis was originally a comment on #3229, we have a work around in place to resolve the issue, but we need to revisit it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem is that when making an API request to invite a user, any errors from sending the email causes the API to respond with a 500 error, and only return the error in the response. On the frontend the result is that ember doesn't get a new user added to its store, but the user WAS added to the database, we just didn't email them.\r\n\r\nThe new user is getting created successfully, so the response should probably be a 201. The error could be included as a [warning header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46), or perhaps we should include both the successful object and the errors in the response - which ought to be downgraded to a warning (an orange notification on the client side).\r\n\r\nThat is, I'm suggesting we change the API to support returning a 200/201 status with a normal resource response body along with either an errors object or along with warning headers. Which ever of the 2 we use, the result should be a success with warnings, rather than a failure.\r\n\r\nWith regard to which is the correct way to do this, JSON-API seems to now specify an [errors object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors) which matches what we have, but it does explicitly state that the `errors` top-level object **should not** be returned with another top-level object. JSON-API does not seem to make any mention of using Warning headers, so this method would at least not be a direct contradiction of the standard."
3849,'',"[WIP] Ghost as middleware\n# Ghost as middleware!\r\nHere is what I have so far for ghost middleware. This works hypothetically, but it is proving tricky to use in practice.\r\n```\r\nvar app = require( 'express' )()\r\nvar ghost = require( 'ghost/core/middleware' )\r\napp.use( ghost() )\r\napp.listen( 8888 )\r\n```\r\n## The Good\r\n- Running the middleware generator lazy-loads ghost in the background, and all requests are buffered until the loading is finished.\r\n- ... it's middleware\r\n\r\n## The Bad\r\nIf I want my blog at `www.joshwillik.com/blog`, `app.use( '/blog', ghost() )` doesn't work because express strips off the /blog from the url before passing the request on, and that confuses Ghost.\r\n\r\nSetting the URL in a config file and `app.use( ghost({ config: __dirname + '/ghost-config.js' })` is a bit better, but that turns Ghost into a catch-all.\r\n\r\nThis might be a seperate issue, but a misconfigured config file produces very opaque errors. For example, if `database.connection.filename` is incorrectly set, SQLite complains with `cannot read property _cid of undefined`.\r\nIf `paths.contentPath` is incorrect, a cryptic `Casper not installed` error is thrown.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution to the app mounting issue is to change the middleware footprint to something this.\r\n```\r\nvar app = require( 'express' )()\r\nvar ghost = require( 'ghost/core/middleware' )\r\napp.use( ghost( '/blog', options ) )\r\napp.listen( 8888 )\r\n```\r\nHowever, setting the url in both the middleware and config feels redundant, and it violates the expected behaviour of express middleware. Perhaps the URL config option could be split into two? `internalURL` for internal routing and `externalURL` for resource and path generation?\r\n\r\nAs for the config errors, I imagine they will be fairly common for Ghost as middleware, so perhaps some checks for those should be added?\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

3801,'',"[Epic] Ghost and i18n\n[Project description](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features): Ghost is currently pretty much UK-based English-language only, and has barely any features to account for timezones, locales, languages, alphabets, keyboard layouts or anything else that isn't UTC/English in either the admin or in themes. Even the USA folks luck out, sorry! All this is set to change with full support for multiple locales and languages across the admin and your blog posts. Throughout the Ghost GitHub, support for all of these sorts of features is referred to as i18n (internationalisation).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ghost effectively doesn't work properly unless you're writing in English or something very similar. Throughout the application, from the ember admin, to the API and even down to themes there are things missing which make it hard to use Ghost if you aren't English speaking.\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended as a placeholder to keep track of all the different places where we know we need to add i18n support so that it becomes possible for anyone to publish content comfortably in their own language and locale.\r\n\r\ni18n for Ghost falls into 2 broad categories\r\n\r\n#### 1. Publish content in your language/locale\r\nWe need to make it possible for anyone to create a blog and publish content which is 100% in their language. This includes extending theme helpers, adding support for non latin-standard chars in URLs and other files, and many other things.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Use Ghost in your language/locale\r\nMuch less important, it would be great for our users if they could have the admin UI appear in their language, with a tailored layout and specific fonts.\r\n\r\n## Features and Support\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of things we know we need to do / make possible / add support for:\r\n\r\n##### Publishing\r\n* Set user and post language, default to the blog language, and allow override\r\n* customisable permalinks where english words are used\r\n* non-latin chars in slugs\r\n* non-latin chars in urls\r\n* non-latin chars when uploading files\r\n* non-latin chars handled by `words` and `characters` features of excerpt/content helpers\r\n* non-latin chars in generated heading `id` attributes\r\n* non-latin chars supported fully in editor\r\n* customisable permalinks for `/tag/`, `/author/`, and `/page/` urls\r\n* locale dates in themes (moment.js language support) \r\n* different plural structures in the `{{plurals}}` helper\r\n* extensible rules for what constitutes paragraphs and words in the excerpt and content helpers\r\n* extensible rules for what constitutes paragraphs and words in the editor\r\n\r\n##### Admin UI\r\n* translate the Admin UI\r\n* locale dates when entering published at date\r\n* register different fonts for use in the admin interface and specifically the editor\r\n* extend the admin interface with layout tweaks for different languages\r\n* install language packs which provide the translations and layout tweaks\r\n* non-latin chars handled by word count and counters on bio/description fields\r\n* ability to include extra character sets in admin via language packs\r\n\r\n\r\n## i18n and Apps\r\n\r\nNot all features and support for other languages will exist in core. Different writing systems require very different layouts and as such it should be expected that if your language is significantly different to English, that an App may be required to make Ghost work for you.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of splitting functionality this way is that we don't have to design one UI that works for all languages and writing systems. Furthermore we don't have to bloat the core of Ghost with features that will only ever be used by one specific group. Language packs which add translations for the Ghost admin UI could also add layout tweaks, better fonts, and other modifications to make Ghost work just as well for other languages as it does for English."
3800,'',"Re-implement the tag editing component\n![](http://puu.sh/aUTdW.png)\r\n\r\nThe tag editing component is one of the more complex pieces of the Ghost admin interface, and it was largely 'ported' to Ember, as opposed to rebuilt in a more ember-y fashion. Unfortunately, it is largely broken, particularly on mobile, and needs a bit of a rethink.\r\n\r\nThe component consists of two main pieces: 1) the suggestions popover, which uses our ember popover component and I believe is working well across all devices, and 2) the tag input, which really needs some love. Any attempt to fix bugs with the current implementation promptly results in a game of whack-a-mole as other things break. I believe it needs rethinking and rebuilding from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis issue exists as a statement of intent that we will rebuild this, either on it's own if someone feels like taking it on, or possibly as part of the work on a new editor.

3237,'novaugust','Move admin from EAK to Ember-Cli\nThe Ember App Kit has been deprecated in favor of [Ember-Cli](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/). \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nThe EAK may be deprecated, but it\'s certainly working for us and will for the foreseeable future. So, why we should bother needs to be addressed\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. Move client build steps out of grunt, woo for smaller gruntfile\r\n2. faster, smarter builds via broccoli\r\n3. hook into the growing ember-addon space (#3584 gets easier, for instance)\r\n4. first class environment configuration\r\n5. It\'s nice? I\'ve been using it at work and liking it, apart from early life issues, but the core team is very responsive, with new releases nearly every other week\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. Another build tool (broccoli)\r\n2. contributors have to `npm install -g ember-cli bower grunt` now\r\n3. i had to write a pros and cons list\r\n\r\n\r\n## Blockers\r\n\r\nThese are the things that I think will make this hard, or that are on my mind\r\n\r\n1. **Grunt vs Broccoli**\r\n\r\n      `grunt dev` runs a watch command that recompiles server or client assets whenever a developer changes a file.  Moving the ember build step to an separate tool (broccoli) means that we need two processes/threads to do this, not just one (ie, `grunt dev` runs `ember build --watch`).  We could potentially leave the watching up to grunt and have it call `ember build` every time, but then we lose the benefit of broccoli intelligently rebuilding\r\n\r\n2. ember-cli thinks it\'s the root of a project\r\n\r\n    ember-cli expects jshint, package.json, and other project-level configurations to be placed at its directory, but that\'s obviously not going to be the case with Ghost.

This is an environment thing that would need configuring via config.js regardless of whether the class is in core, or a separate file\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that alternative file storage classes may want to:\r\n- change the location of where things live to another location locally or remotely \r\n- change how stuff is stored from being in files to being in a database\r\n- implement mirroring between the local storage and remote storage like a CDN\r\n\r\nThere is a chicken and egg problem to consider with apps - given that apps are one of the things being stored, can they really be used to configure alternative storage (given that the config is still in config.js)? This will need some smart / careful use of the `fileStorage` setting in config.js to make sure things happen sanely.\r\n\r\nFinally, consideration is needed with regard to using different storage for different things - perhaps themes and apps live somewhere different to images?

2740,'','[Discussion] Permission dependencies\nI’m branching this off of #2739 as I think this deserves more discussion:\r\n\r\nI am having trouble with the Notification permissions.\r\n\r\nOnce we have multi-user I think it is more than likely that apps would want to show persistent notifications (“Your article foo was published by $editor”). This would mean that notifications need to relate to a certain user. This user should then be allowed to delete the notification (so Admin + me).\r\n\r\nConsidering the “Please set up an email transport” notification on startup: A notification should only be shown for users in a certain role (in this case only for Admins) - an editor / author would not care about the notification (are they allowed to delete it though?).\r\n\r\nI think a similar permission issue may arise with posts: Is an author allowed to delete his own posts (right now the answer is no)? What does an author do when he accidentally created a post - call an editor?\r\n\r\nI think it would be beneficial to introduce a self permission for BREAD operations, meaning that I can execute those operations if I created the entity in question. A use-case for this might be for posts: An author cannot read posts unless they are his own.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that at some point people will be able to change roles / permissions we should think about how permissions depend on one another: `theme.edit` uses `theme.browse` to validate that the theme that the user is trying to activate actually exists. If I were to create a new role where I allow a user to `edit` but not `browse` themes (because $reasons) it would break the `theme.edit` api method. A solution would be to move the `{ internal: true }` we have introduced for the settings API up into the permissions check (how would the settings api know that it is allowed to touch core settings?).\r\n\r\n'

2584,'',"[Discussion] Apps - the best approach to commenting systems\nOne of the most popular modifications people make to their Ghost blog, is to add comments. This is a relatively straightforward amend to make to a theme at present, but when Apps become available we expect it to become a matter of a few clicks.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the commenting systems that can be integrated with Ghost at present (if you know of others please leave a comment and I will add it to the list):\r\n\r\n* [Disqus](http://disqus.com)\r\n* [LiveFyre](http://web.livefyre.com/)\r\n* [Moot](https://muut.com/)\r\n* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/) \r\n* [Google+ Comments](http://bioselemental.com/ghost-adding-google-comments/)\r\n* [Annote](http://annote.in/)\r\n* [NodeBB](http://blog.nodebb.org/nodebb-v0-3-2-released/)\r\n* [Isso](http://posativ.org/isso/)\r\n* [Intense Debate](http://intensedebate.com/)\r\n* [Juvia](https://github.com/phusion/juvia)\r\n\r\nThese solutions all have slightly different approaches to how they can be integrated, but it almost always requires embedding some extra code into the blog page. Therefore we need to make sure there is a simple way to integrate between the app and any theme. That is, there needs to be an easy way for themes to support the addition of comments with minimal impact or effort on everyone's part.\r\n\r\nAt present we have `{{ghost_foot}}` which enables us to embed code in every page. This will likely be augmented by code injection #1993, however this isn't a suitable solution for comments for two related reasons: firstly, because most comment systems require the code to be injected at the point where the comments should appear, and secondly because comments are usually only wanted on blog posts, i.e. only in `post.hbs` not anywhere else.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose a new helper:\r\n\r\n`{{comments}}`\r\n\r\nThis can be placed by theme developers wherever comments should appear, and can be leveraged by comment app authors to output their code via an api method something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar code = '<script....</script>';\r\nthis.ghost.registerComments(code);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe upside to this suggestion is that `{{comments}}` can be added to themes long before it does anything. In fact, we can get theme developers to do something like this for added flexibility:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{#if comments}}\r\n  {{comments}}\r\n{{else}}\r\n... current comment solution goes here...\r\n{{/if}}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe downside to this is that it requires theme authors (or users) to do some work in order to get comments working. Not all themes are kept up to date. So it's worth considering whether we can add a fall back for where comments get inserted if `{{comments}}` doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nThis begs a second question about how to tell if a theme supports certain features... can we detect them? Or should we get theme authors to declare their feature support in `package.json` somewhere? This is probably a different discussion though.\r\n\r\nAnother downside to this helper is that it is very, very specific. This is good in some regards, comments are a very common piece of functionality so it's probably not a superfluous helper... but comment systems have one other common feature that isn't supported by this helper, which is displaying a comment count. So do we also add `{{comment_count}}`? Or do we get comment apps to implement that helper if they support it? Adding 2 helpers seems a lot, but getting individual apps to implement a helper means they probably won't do it consistently.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm throwing this open to discussion. Is there a better way?"

An additional named context parameter would help to make context based decisions when filtering.\r\n\r\nIn this issue I’d like to discuss a way to let the filter know in which context it is applied. `prePostRender`  is applied both to render posts for the frontend and for rss feeds.\r\n\r\n1. Do we need to define named contexts like `rss`, `homepage`, `single` (which would match the controller methods and could be probably be auto-applied)?\r\n2. Should they be auto-applied? \r\n3.

I’m not 100% certain that we need both, I believe that `rss.feed` would have access to all the data so could be used to do both, but I’m willing to be shown I’m wrong on this.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it would be great to get the rss filter into place so that it can be used in anger to create real world apps.\r\n'

A good example being filtering the meta data provided by the `{{ghost_head}}` helper.\r\n\r\nThe data API allows Apps access to the CRUD methods of the JSON API.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is considered that Apps may also wish to hook into, or be notified of when an event happens in Ghost - for example when a new post is published. These are ‘Fire and Forget’ notifications where there is no guarantee or knowledge of when all apps have finished responding, and no concept of priority (filters provides both these things).\r\n\r\nIn WP there is the concept of filters (again for changing data) and actions which are like events but PHP. In JavaScript we have real events.\r\n\r\nThe first question is shall we call this feature Actions, Events or Notifications?\r\n\r\nThe second is how to implement it, and what to do about considerations like permissions? Do these things still have enough information (i.e. what the current user is) to have access to things which require permissions?\r\n\r\nThoughts on a postcard please :)\r\n'

2333,'','[Ember.js] - The Future of Ghost Mobile\nAs we rebuild ghost in ember.js - we have some important considerations which need to be taken into account around mobile. \r\n\r\nRight now - our "mobile support" consists of CSS3 media queries.... and that\'s about it. *Most* things break on mobile at this stage, especially on iOS7, especially on the editor screen. \r\n\r\nMobile is the number 1 biggest complaint which we receive via our "what would you like to see improved the most?" popup survey on Ghost.org - and I strongly believe this needs to be a part of everything we do, rather than tacked on as an afterthought.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that I think Ember is going to allow us to do some really, really exciting things with mobile that I\'m really looking forward to. But before that, this slideshow is mandatory viewing for participation in this issue:\r\n\r\nhttp://mattandrews.info/talks/port80-2013/#/\r\n\r\n## Doing Mobile Right\r\n\r\nThere are three critical elements that I believe we need to detect and adapt to throughout every aspect of Ghost Admin:\r\n\r\n1. Viewport size\r\n2. Device capability\r\n3. Connection speed\r\n\r\nEmber affords us the capability (as I understand it) to be very aggressive with serving different UI and interactions based on these parameters - so this is something I think we need to think about quite carefully.\r\n\r\nSo, let\'s recap a couple of core responsive principles to make sure we\'re all on the same page - and to lead into why I think this is particularly exciting.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 primary accepted ways of approaching responsive web ***design*** (development is another thing):\r\n\r\n**Desktop First** - This is arguably what we do now. All styles and scripts are written for Ghost Admin as it appears on a large viewport. As the viewport shrinks, media queries are enlisted to modify the UI to fit a small screen. Some things shrink, some things move, and some things disappear. It\'s the same UI - but rearranged to be smaller.\r\n\r\n**Mobile First** - This is the opposite. All styles and scripts are written to initially target a small viewport, and *if* a viewport is larger, then additional styles/scripts are loaded in. This is the trendy hipster "if you don\'t do it this way you aren\'t a real developer" one that everyone loves to rave about - because the performance is better.\r\n\r\nIMO - in the context of a complex user interface - Neither of these are ideal. They both target one primary viewport and then compromise on whatever is considered to be the secondary. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because they still have to have all the same elements on a page. Either the mobile version is hiding a bunch of shit, or the desktop version is missing a bunch of shit. Ultimately - the DOM is either a mess or a graveyard because responsive design doesn\'t just mean making UI **look** different - it means different UI.\r\n\r\n### So What *is* Ideal?\r\n\r\nThe best mobile user experience by some margin, is from dedicated mobile websites. mobile.twitter.com and m.facebook.com are the most obvious examples of this. These mobile websites feel like native apps. They\'re fast, they\'re slick, and they have largely very different sets of elements to their desktop counterparts.\r\n\r\nBut - mobile websites themselves aren\'t ideal. They\'re an entirely different codebase. And entirely different app. They\'re usually overly specific to just one particular viewport size (really? everything 400px and below is mobile? What about 420px? 450px? 600px? hmmm)\r\n\r\n### The Combo Move\r\n\r\nHere\'s where shit gets fun - and where I think Ember might allow us to do some things which haven\'t been experimented with to any great length before (at least not that I\'ve seen) - which is to adapt our DOM based on our predefined responsive criteria. \r\n\r\nThat\'s viewport size, device capability and connection speed - for those of you playing along at home.\r\n\r\nThe DOM, in some ways, is really the most important thing behind every single piece of responsive work. It is the dominant factor that influences the outcome, if you will.\r\n\r\n## DOMinant Design™\r\n\r\n> (Oh no he didn\'t!)\r\n\r\nOh yes he did.\r\n\r\nAnyway - this has been a long back story to arrive at a single, relatively simple point which I\'m interested in:\r\n\r\n**What if we used Ember to serve entirely different UI components to different devices based on what will work best for them?**\r\n\r\nA few very basic examples for context:\r\n\r\n* Navigation menu - serve a completely different nav (like 4 icons fixed to the bottom of the screen) instead of trying to re-squish everything into some horrendous "menu" dropdown.\r\n* Editor - serve a simple fullscreen text input rather than the (enormous, mobile-hating) CodeMirror implementation.\r\n* Settings - serve the list of settings pages as one view, and navigate between the sub views after tapping on them (Rather than loading them all at the same time, as on desktop) - we do this in a very basic + broken way already with jQuery, there\'s a lot of room for improvement.\r\n* Allow switching between post-previews on /ghost/ (content management) by swiping left/right to go to prev/next items in the list\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: I\'m not saying we should do all of these, they\'re just examples of interesting DOM changes which could significantly improve the mobile experience.*\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended as a starting point for a discussion on how this type of approach can be integrated into what we do with ember at a very high level. I am not intending to come up with an exhaustive list of every possible mobile UI enhancement that we could create. Rather, that we build Ghost admin with sufficient flexibility so that it is possible to experiment with things like this as we grow.\r\n\r\nI\'m no [Brad Frost](https://speakerdeck.com/brad_frost/beyond-media-queries-anatomy-of-an-adaptive-web-design) - and there are undoubtedly people who have more experience both with designing and implementing UI patterns like this. So I\'m interested to hear any other points of view on the general approach as well as the implementation as it relates to ember.'

It is also intended that app settings would have a type which relates to the type of data it is going to store (see #2102).\r\n\r\nTo go along with the data and type, there will need to be a way for settings to define what sort of input to display to the user.\r\n\r\nShort term, that might be one of a text field, textarea, checkbox, or dropdown.

2030,'','Refactor flow of error rendering\nAt the moment, all errors (404, or 50*) get rendered using the following templates:\r\n\r\n* In the admin\r\n    * we use the `server/views/error.hbs` template\r\n* On the frontend \r\n    * if the theme does *not* have an `error.hbs` template, we use `server/views/user-error.hbs`\r\n    * if the theme *does* have an `error.hbs` template, we use that\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is an error when attempting to render the error template, we fall back to using `res.send` with some really basic super-ugly HTML. This is because it is reasonably common for custom themes to have errors on the error template, and we need to be sure to catch them.\r\n\r\nIt may be better to refactor the way errors are handled on the frontend so that:\r\n\r\n`user-error.hbs` becomes `default-error.hbs`\r\n\r\nWe attempt to render 40* errors using the theme template, but 50* errors always use the `default-error.hbs`\r\n\r\nThis way if we can do the following with the error templates:\r\n\r\n404 (theme) -> 500 (default) -> 500 (basic HTML).\r\n\r\nBut if we\'re rendering a 500 we would always do\r\n\r\n500 (default) -> 500 (basic HTML)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could refactor the frontend errors to attempt to use the theme template, and if that fails attempt to use the default, and finally revert to basic HTML. If we\'re doing this, we could also support separate `error404` and `error500` in themes.\r\n\r\nSo we would do:\r\n\r\n404 (theme) -> 500 (theme) -> 500 (default) -> 500 (basic HTML)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n500 (theme) -> 500 (default) -> 500 (basic HTML)\r\n\r\nHowever, if we get a string of errors like this, we need smart way to display the fact that we encountered the latest error, whilst trying to render an error page for the original error.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there can only be a rendering error and an original error and we output it in the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n"<h1>Oops, seems there is an an error in the error template.</h1>"\r\n                    + "<p>Encountered the error: </p>"\r\n                    + "<pre>" + hbs.handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression(templateErr.message || templateErr) + "</pre>"\r\n                    + "<br ><p>whilst trying to render an error page for the error: </p>"\r\n                    + code + " " + "<pre>"  + hbs.handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression(err.message || err) + "</pre>"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally we need to consider what happens to 40* errors that are not 404 errors.'

Ghost doesn't always tell people when something has gone a bit wrong... it can often just serve a non-OK response and sometimes the error can appear as a rendered 500 page but there's nothing in the log. We also don't log when we get empty responses from the DB etc.. we just carry on.\r\n\r\nI want to look at how we can improve this without adding too much code.

If anyone thinks otherwise do let me know!\r\n\r\nThe toolkit should also provide for displaying these shortcuts when the `?` key is pressed as per #883 in such a way that the correct shortcut is presented for the current platform as per #348 (this means both displaying the correct shortcut for the platform and using the char ⌘ instead of Cmd). \r\n\r\n#1273 is an issue with the modals in Ghost, we need to investigate whether we can fix this, or whether it would be better to use http://www.impressivewebs.com/questionmark-js-shortcut-keys-displayed/ as suggested in #883.\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to redesign the shortcuts themselves such that they do not clash with functions or secondary/tertiary characters on the various platforms and layouts.\r\n\r\nThe worst ones for clashing are the headings. The suggested solution is to use `ctrl` + `h` to output a 2nd level heading by default, and then use the number after in sequence to change it to another heading so `ctrl` + `h`, `3` would make a 3rd level heading.\r\n\r\nSo there are 3 main parts to this:\r\n\r\n- [x] replace shortcuts.js with mousetrap (or keymaster if we change our minds)\r\n- [x] introduce a better way of defining shortcuts, so that we can have different shortcuts for different things (markdown, editor, content screen, etc)\r\n- [ ] improve the UI for displaying shortcuts\r\n- [x] switch over markdown shortcuts to ones which do not clash cross-platform and layout\r\n\r\nI\'d like to see this done in a way such that it is kept away from the existing code as much as possible - it should be a module or a plugin.'

1260,'gotdibbs',"Ugly debug upgrade tool\nI would like to start investigating adding an upgrade tool for Ghost. There's no UI yet so it can live on the ugly debug tools page.\r\n\r\n**Part 1:**  would be to have a 'check for updates' button. It should be possible to make a request to `http://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip`, then read and parse the location header on the response which will be something like `http://d36u7lo2kegj1p.cloudfront.net/archives/ghost-0.3.3.zip`\r\n\r\nWe can then match the version number from the location header, with the version number in package.json to determine whether or not there is an upgrade.\r\n\r\n**Part 2:** would be to have a second 'Upgrade Ghost' button appear if an update is found. \r\n\r\nA backup of the database should be made using exporter before proceeding. The upgrade button should then make a http request to fetch the `http://ghost.org/zip/ghost-latest.zip` zip file into a freshly created `/content/tmp/` folder and unpack the archive.  The Ghost core/ folder and root files should then be copied over the top of the existing install. \r\n\r\nThe user should be presented with an option (probably a checkbox above the 'Upgrade Ghost' button which is selected by default) to choose whether or not the Casper files are also updated.\r\n\r\nFinally, once the files have been successfully copied into place, a message should be displayed clearly indicating that the user must manually restart Ghost before the changes will take effect."

This can be useful if extending Ghost to publish content that is in more of a book or slideshow format.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with implementing this would be the complexity of the current `findPage` code, which does need extracting out and making DRY.

827,'','Proposal: expose Ghost as reusable express middleware\nIt would be cool if Ghost could be installed as an npm module, and then used as middleware in any express app. So you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar express = require("express");\r\nvar ghost = require("ghost");\r\n\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\napp.get(\'/\', function(req, res) {\r\n  res.send(\'hello world\');\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar blog = ghost({\r\n    contentDirectory: "./ghost-blog-content"\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.use(blog.middleware({\r\n    urlRoot: "/blog"\r\n}));\r\n\r\napp.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotably both the content directory, and the url it is served from are configurable here. It could also be interesting to experiment with allowing the front-end, admin interface and public API to all be served from separate custom locations.\r\n\r\nThis would allow all sorts of possibilities such as having multiple Ghost blogs in the same server, and embedding ghost as part of a larger CMS product... Obviously this would need to be in addition to it working standalone, but I don\'t think that would be too difficult to manage (the standalone version could just be a thin wrapper around the middleware version).\r\n\r\nThoughts?'

332,'',"Content Security Policy\nI know this probably isn't a huge priority for 0.3, but we should think about incorporating [content-security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Security/CSP) headers, at least for the admin panel, and possibly for the user theme too (although we'll probably need to give them the ability to turn it off for the theme — can't protect users from themselves!)\r\n\r\n**Rationale:** CSP is widely supported by modern browsers and is totally ignored by those which don't — meaning it can't damage the experience for substandard UAs. While CSP won't stop us from falling victim to XSS vulnerabilities, it will dramatically limit their scope and severity.\r\n\r\nImplementation, once we've agreed on what policy we want to establish, is trivial —only requiring the creation of an express middleware function which simply sets the relevant headers headers (possibly read out of config.)\r\n\r\nWhile 0.3 is probably out the window for CSP, we should think about incorporating it before too much development on Ghost (which might not play so well with CSP if not planned for) is undertaken."
